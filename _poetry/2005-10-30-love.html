<p>Making your heart beat,<br/>
Chocking you in your throat,<br/>
The smile of a stranger,<br/>
Melts your insides,<br/>
Is something wrong with me,<br/>
That the littlest attention<br/>
makes me giddy for a day?<br/>
Or is it called love,<br/>
That you fall head over heels into,<br/>
It is a sea, pulling you in,<br/>
Never letting go,<br/>
Until one day you’re alone,<br/>
Sad and lonely, friendless…<br/>
So much for love.</p>
