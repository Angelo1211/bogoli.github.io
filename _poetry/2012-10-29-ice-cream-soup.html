<p>it used to be<br/>
that’d we’d swirl our spoons<br/>
around and around <br/>
and make our own soft serve ice cream soup<br/>
mom would tell us not to play with our food<br/>
but we did anyway.<br/>
Now it’s a decade later<br/>
and the ice cream scoops melt along the bottom<br/>
and slide inside my bowl<br/>
as I slice little half moons with my spoon<br/>
not even mixing a little<br/>
I’ve grown up<br/>
and now <br/>
the melty  makes me sad<br/>
and I’ve forgotten how to play.</p>
