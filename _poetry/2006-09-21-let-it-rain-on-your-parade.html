<p>Sing in the rain,<br/>
Dance in the street,<br/>
Go overboard,<br/>
&amp; set sail today.</p>

<p>Don’t give a damn,<br/>
If it rains on my parade,<br/>
Life doesn’t end,<br/>
When the floats get wet.<br/>
The candy still flies,<br/>
Wet though it is,<br/>
Straight to the greedy<br/>
Children’s hands</p>

<p>Jump into life,<br/>
Just do it, go ahead.<br/>
Nothing to it.<br/>
Step into space,<br/>
Dive headfirst,<br/>
Don’t worry about the<br/>
Safety net,<br/>
It’s not there,<br/>
It won’t ever be.</p>

<p>Jump,<br/>
Head over heels,<br/>
For the one,<br/>
You love,<br/>
Even if,<br/>
They break your heart.<br/>
Let it rain.<br/>
On your parade.</p>
