<p>Accidents can happen<br/>
Though they are unpleasant<br/>
They can happen to a king<br/>
or a common peasant<br/>
Sometimes they are fatal<br/>
Sometimes they are not<br/>
Sometimes it can be replaced<br/>
Sometimes it can be bought<br/>
Sometimes it can be hurtful,<br/>
Physical I mean<br/>
As big as an elephant<br/>
as small as a bean<br/>
Who will care?<br/>
we are all here together<br/>
to bear what we can bear</p>
