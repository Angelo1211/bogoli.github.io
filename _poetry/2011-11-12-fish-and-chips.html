<p>As he walked away,<br/>
Excuse me?<br/>
Could we get some malt vinegar?<br/>
I asked him to ask.<br/>
It wasnâ€™t the same.<br/>
I shook it on mediocre fish and chips.<br/>
A few fries, a few bites.<br/>
Conversation.<br/>
Time passes.<br/>
The fries grow cold and stale,<br/>
and as I put one in my mouth,<br/>
hoping to savor the moment,<br/>
one more time,<br/>
I realize<br/>
an era<br/>
has passed.</p>
