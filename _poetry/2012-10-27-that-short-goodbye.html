<p>there’s more feeling <br/>
in that short goodbye <br/>
than all the other goodbyes in my life<br/>
a distilled goodbye, you could call it<br/>
when I know in my gut that I’ll see you again<br/>
when I know in my heart that you’ll be there<br/>
Goodbye is a menial thing<br/>
a fold in time<br/>
a skip in the disk of our lives together<br/>
I’ll see you again<br/>
I’ll hear your voice again<br/>
we both know<br/>
and that’s why there’s no sorrow<br/>
in our short goodbye.</p>
