<p>I wanted to write, <br/>
to spill what I feel,<br/>
to see what is there,<br/>
and to see what is real<br/>
but<br/>
You confuddled my senses, <br/>
and then broke my pen, <br/>
crumpled my paper <br/>
and invaded my brain. <br/>
I can&rsquo;t write about you<br/>
So what can I do?<br/>
I can waffle and brood<br/>
and worsen my mood<br/>
My poems never rhyme<br/>
I never have time<br/>
I don&rsquo;t ever want them to,<br/>
either. <br/>
but you broke my way of thinking<br/>
and now I&rsquo;m confused.<br/>
What do you want?<br/>
I wish that I knew<br/>
This silence <br/>
drives me insane<br/>
I don&rsquo;t feel any pain<br/>
just uncertainty<br/>
do I rhyme?<br/>
or do I not.<br/>
Punctuations;<br/>
punctuate my thought.<br/>
Maybe I punctuate yours.<br/>
I wish you&rsquo;d punctuate<br/>
the silence.<br/>
…<br/>
an ellipsis,<br/>
You’d choose. <br/>
wrought with omission. <br/>
That&rsquo;s what I chose, anyway. <br/>
It comes after intros,<br/>
And after good times,<br/>
The hope of more stories<br/>
Of line after line. <br/>
does it continue from here?<br/>
does it ebb and flow?<br/>
does it trickle off? <br/>
And where does it go?<br/>
questions, no answers<br/>
and nothing to do.<br/>
but.<br/>
wait.<br/>
and maybe &ndash; <br/>
go back;<br/>
and!<br/>
punctuate. <br/>
will you em dash to me?<br/>
or will I finally see<br/>
the footnote disclaimer<br/>
&ldquo;Only sane ones allowed.&rdquo;<br/>
It&rsquo;s not really my fault<br/>
I think that you&rsquo;d see<br/>
if you took the time<br/>
to really look at me.<br/>
Look at me, still rhyming,<br/>
(with the same shit words, too!)<br/>
trying to make sense,<br/>
in some small way,<br/>
of the words in my head<br/>
that you&rsquo;re making me say. <br/>
Rawr.<br/>
So many words,<br/>
but you took them away.<br/>
I wanted to write,<br/>
because I wanted to know.<br/>
and you took away both. <br/>
thus, this is woe.<br/>
You overestimate, however,<br/>
the assumptions you make,<br/>
and underestimate me,<br/>
what I leave in my wake.<br/>
what happens now <br/>
is up to you<br/>
but I hope that I know soon,<br/>
If my desiderata<br/>
have many errata<br/>
Or is it just <br/>
Hakuna Matata?</p>
