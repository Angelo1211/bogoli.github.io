<p>I wish there were cairns for life<br/>
just little stacks of stones<br/>
little pillars of pebbles<br/>
roadsigns of rock<br/>
telling me I’m on the right track<br/>
it’s unfortunate, however<br/>
that two such strong desires <br/>
are so very, truly, mutually exclusive. <br/>
For if I want to go <br/>
where no one has gone before<br/>
roads unestablished<br/>
paths undefined<br/>
trails unblazed<br/>
there will be no cairns<br/>
and no semblance of assurance<br/>
that this is the way to go.<br/>
I want that assurance<br/>
but I don’t want to want it<br/>
someone show me an invisible cairn<br/>
something I can feel with my soul
instead of see with my eyes
something that comes from within<br/>
a cairn made of pieces of rightness<br/>
that I laid there some time in the future.</p>
