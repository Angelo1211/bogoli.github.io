<p>walking <br/> crowds around me<br/> rubbing shoulders<br/> with people I don&rsquo;t like<br/> that one guy with the guitar<br/> and the couple sitting on concrete <br/> selling graffiti on canvas<br/> I glance across a mercedes<br/> maybe a beemer or two<br/> a stranger<br/> lounging<br/> against the streetlight<br/> defining nonchalant<br/> piercing eyes<br/> how can an instant be an eternity?<br/> I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck Filip was talking about<br/> but those weren&rsquo;t moments<br/> this is.</p>
