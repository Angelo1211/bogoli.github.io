<p>Amidst the sounds of coughs<br/>
and quiet conversations<br/>
the beeping of the book scanner<br/>
and the intermittent piercing sneeze<br/>
Among the sounds of footsteps<br/>
metallic backpack zippers<br/>
doors opening and closing<br/>
and clicky clack of keyboards,<br/>
Between the hum of air vents<br/>
and the buzzing phones on tables<br/>
the lightly tapping pencils<br/>
and the louder, heaving sighs</p>

<p>I heard the loudest<br/>
THUNK<br/>
and then everything went silent.</p>

<p>I glanced over to my left<br/>
through grid of big gray girders<br/>
through the dusty, dirty glass,<br/>
and I saw a poor dazed robin.</p>

<p>He lay there twitching,<br/>
flailing sadly<br/>
desperation soaring<br/>
while he lay there on the ground.<br/>
rumpled feathers<br/>
blowing in the breeze<br/>
his feet gave one kick,<br/>
then two more<br/>
then the life was gone.</p>

<p>His body slowly cooling,<br/>
I looked around to find<br/>
that nobody had noticed,<br/>
and nobody had cried.</p>

<p>9/16/13</p>
