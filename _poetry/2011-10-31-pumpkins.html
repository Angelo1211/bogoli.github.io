<p>Snow stings my face with icy fingers.<br/>
deceptively sharp<br/>
for something that floats<br/>
so gracefully and lightly<br/>
in the brutal wind.<br/>
The excitement of the crowd<br/>
barely dampened<br/>
by the weather.<br/>
Pumpkins fall<br/>
like so many inverted fireworks<br/>
upside down<br/>
and a little muffled<br/>
and nowhere near <br/>
as brilliant.<br/>
Pumpkins fall<br/>
and splatter<br/>
break and bust.<br/>
and die<br/>
with October.</p>
