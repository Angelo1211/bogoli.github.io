<p>A crystalline structure<br/>
of water and cold<br/>
Twinkles in the moonlight,<br/>
As glamourous as the moon itself,<br/>
The light concentrated in<br/>
its symetry<br/>
its arms wave gaily<br/>
to its brethren,<br/>
Twirling down<br/>
to the cold ground below.<br/>
Sailing happily,<br/>
Not knowing of the end,<br/>
so near,<br/>
when death<br/>
will crush<br/>
its fragile limbs,<br/>
and never<br/>
release it<br/>
from its grasp.</p>
