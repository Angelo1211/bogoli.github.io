<p>Thinking of the memories,<br/>
All the things,<br/>
That could have been,<br/>
Would have been,<br/>
Should have been,<br/>
Now long past,<br/>
Long forgotten,<br/>
Except by me,<br/>
The nostalgia queen.</p>

<p>The good times,<br/>
Swamp me with their joy,<br/>
The laughs,<br/>
The smiles,<br/>
All visit me,<br/>
And I relive each one,<br/>
Relishing the sweetness,<br/>
Of each and every one.</p>

<p>The bad times come, too,<br/>
Inevitable,<br/>
Though uninvited,<br/>
With the silver lining,<br/>
Comes the could,<br/>
The memories bittersweet,<br/>
The tears,<br/>
The cries,<br/>
The insufferable sadness.</p>

<p>I push the tears away,<br/>
Push the cloud away<br/>
Willing the silver lining to stay,<br/>
And sometimes it does,<br/>
And sometimes it doesn’t,<br/>
But either way,<br/>
I’m left with a feeling,<br/>
Bittersweet,<br/>
Of memories,<br/>
Good times,<br/>
Friends, love,<br/>
And family,<br/>
Laughs, smiles,<br/>
And tears.</p>

<p>A wry smile is left on my face,<br/>
When visited by,<br/>
Nostalgia.</p>
