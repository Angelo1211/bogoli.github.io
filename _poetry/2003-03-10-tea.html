<p>Tea sounds as wonderful<br/>
as it really is<br/>
You relax with it when<br/>
everyoneâ€™s all abuzz<br/>
When you get back from skiing<br/>
with smelly socks and a movie,<br/>
Tea right then is really<br/>
quite groovy<br/>
When you drink it up<br/>
it sits warm in your tummy<br/>
It makes you all toasty<br/>
I like tea, yummy!</p>
