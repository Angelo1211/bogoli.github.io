<p>Poetry as Performance.<br/>
Amtrak<br/>
How are your teeth today?<br/>
3.5 minutes long<br/>
Give it to me, I am every one.<br/>
Our shots, not our thoughts, are true<br/>
Buried in the poem.<br/>
I’m on my second day with Vivienne.<br/>
You know, vocalizing.<br/>
I was in it, and they weren’t.<br/>
Gorgeous tattoos.<br/>
Lobster on a leash<br/>
Enter the poem through another door<br/>
Maybe it’ll regain its freshness.<br/>
Often I rehearsed poems<br/>
walking down the street.<br/>
The Kennedy Finale<br/>
at a wedding.<br/>
People love hearing a line sizzle and hum<br/>
like a beautiful coin<br/>
I feel like I should stop there.<br/>
I always write in a Boston accent.<br/>
She looks a little disappointed.<br/>
We’re leaving<br/>
losing it.<br/>
Thanks for coming.</p>
