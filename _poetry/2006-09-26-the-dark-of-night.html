<p>When the stars come out,<br/>
In a sky of night,<br/>
Bright pearls of hope,<br/>
In the blackness of despair,<br/>
One by one,<br/>
Or by couples and pairs,<br/>
They light up the dark,<br/>
For the stragglers of life.<br/>
They piece it with happiness,<br/>
Their beauty counters and balances<br/>
The gaping hole of the sky;<br/>
Droplets of mercury,<br/>
On a backdrop of black velvet,<br/>
One burns, dies,<br/>
Another born,<br/>
Replacing the light<br/>
With its own unique glow.<br/>
In their bright whites<br/>
We see color,<br/>
Just as in the black sky,<br/>
We see night.<br/>
Above them all,<br/>
An orb of misty light<br/>
Guiding the vagabonds<br/>
Smiling at the children,<br/>
A sphere shrouded in mystery,<br/>
The way it drapes the light,<br/>
In the dark of night.</p>
