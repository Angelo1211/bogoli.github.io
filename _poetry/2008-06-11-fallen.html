<p>Have you ever fallen<br/>
so low<br/>
that the pits of hell<br/>
rise like skyscrapers<br/>
above you?<br/>
Fallen so low<br/>
the air is hostile<br/>
and each breath you draw<br/>
rattles in your lungs,<br/>
the sounds of chains<br/>
and shackles<br/>
a prisoner of what you did.<br/>
Pain sears your heart<br/>
with each and every breath,<br/>
coursing through your veins<br/>
like wildfire.<br/>
Have you ever fallen<br/>
so low<br/>
that no help can reach you<br/>
and you have to climb,<br/>
out of the pit<br/>
with each and every fiber of goodness<br/>
in you<br/>
and still<br/>
you fall.</p>

<p>Fallen so low<br/>
that the good look down<br/>
on the bad<br/>
and the bad look down<br/>
on you<br/>
Your heart, cracking<br/>
into a million fragments<br/>
a mirror of what you&rsquo;ve done<br/>
It tore everything apart.<br/>
Heaven and earth<br/>
are far above you<br/>
and everything looks down<br/>
on you.<br/>
Help.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve fallen.</p>
