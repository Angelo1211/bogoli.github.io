<p>such a dirty, dirty word.<br/>
but not dirty enough to spit<br/>
there’s not enough venom<br/>
and the poison is lost<br/>
it’s too soft<br/>
in-som-ni-ahhhhh<br/>
like a sigh<br/>
a breath<br/>
so sick and evil and twisted<br/>
how can such softness <br/>
weave such twisted, hard-ass shackles<br/>
around my poor mashed mind?<br/>
to be held captive <br/>
by one’s own thoughts<br/>
to be tortured so brutally<br/>
with sweet bliss lurking moments away, just out of reach<br/>
taunting<br/>
leering<br/>
sabotaging the peacefulness of night<br/>
punctuating the silence with heaving sighs<br/>
and tossing sheets<br/>
sounds not tumultuous enough to express <br/>
the tumult of my thoughts<br/>
but just enough<br/>
to keep sleep at bay.<br/>
come to me,<br/>
I whisper<br/>
hold me close<br/>
I breathe<br/>
but only silence answers<br/>
silence<br/>
and my swirling thoughts<br/>
but sleep, my sweet, eludes me.</p>
