<p>After so much thought of masks and onions <br/>
I thought I could peel you, slowly. <br/>
And I thought I was sharing it all, in a way. <br/>
Maybe I’d get all the way, <br/>
One day<br/>
I thought I was open<br/>
And I thought you were closed <br/>
Until one thing you did <br/>
Caught me, breathless, reeling, incomprehensibly confused. <br/>
You wrote me a poem. <br/>
But it wasn’t to me. <br/>
And I watched you craft it<br/>
And I became you<br/>
But never had I ever imagined the feelings that would follow. <br/>
.<br/>
Writing was mine. Writing is mine. <br/>
I hoard it, I coax it, I fiendishly scribble,<br/>
And I lock it away. <br/>
Writing is mine. <br/>
You wrote and I felt it was mine. <br/>
Incredibly selfish, I know. <br/>
All I ever thought I wanted<br/>
Was for someone to become my poem, completely. <br/>
And it happened.<br/>
But I was Alice.<br/>
And your poem was the looking glass. <br/>
And I wondered and wondered what it was that stole my breath. <br/>
You took a plunge, but it wasn’t really, not for you. <br/>
It would have been for me. <br/>
Prefaces. <br/>
Explanations. <br/>
Hesitations. <br/>
Doubt. <br/>
Nerves. <br/>
Judgement. <br/>
I don’t know how you knew. <br/>
Intuition? <br/>
Or blatant disregard of judgement that made you so openly honest?<br/>
Did you even know what you’d make me feel?<br/>
Is that even what you wanted?<br/>
It doesn’t matter. <br/>
Because the slight twang of jealousy<br/>
Had ripped through my heart. <br/>
Something I had thought was my nature<br/>
Became cold.  <br/>
calculated. <br/>
construction. <br/>
Before your frank, blatant, devil may care way of poetry. <br/>
And I never felt fake with my poems. <br/>
now.<br/>
but never again.</p>
