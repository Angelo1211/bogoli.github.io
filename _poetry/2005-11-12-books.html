<p>A portal to a magical world,<br/>
In the pages of a book.<br/>
The gift of letters and words awaits,<br/>
If you would just look…</p>

<p>Knights, queens, and dragons,<br/>
Fairies, and pixies, and leprechauns,<br/>
Things not even imaginable,<br/>
Waiting for an open door, a chance to escape,</p>

<p>So many things lie undiscovered,<br/>
So many places we could go,<br/>
Catch them before they’re gone,<br/>
Think of everything you could know…</p>
