<p>Sitting<br/>
Waiting<br/>
in vain hope<br/>
that knowledge<br/>
has seeped into my mind<br/>
and will now drip<br/>
through graphite<br/>
and magically appear<br/>
in formulas<br/>
on the paper.<br/>
Every few minutes,<br/>
chalk numbers are replaced,<br/>
by counter parts smaller and smaller<br/>
and vain hope dims<br/>
into non-existence.</p>
