Demons    
like dust bunnies    
who knows where they hide?     
     
Sometimes the best    
Intentions     
Bring them out from inside.    

Dust bunnies     
However,     
Their fury subsides     
     
They spin and they spin      
But they go back      
Cast aside.      
      
Demons however,      
They don't stop once awake.    
They linger     
And finger     
And prod.
