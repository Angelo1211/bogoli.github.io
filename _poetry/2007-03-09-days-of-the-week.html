<p>Mondays are for<br/>
Madness,<br/>
And math,<br/>
And mythical<br/>
Bad karma,<br/>
In the spirit,<br/>
Of Monday.</p>

<p><!-- more -->
Tuesdays are for,<br/>
Tumbles down the stairs,<br/>
Tumultuous times,<br/>
For twisters,<br/>
And tsunamis,<br/>
And thunder,<br/>
Terrible Tuesdays,<br/>
Waiting ahead.</p>

<p>Wednesdays are for,<br/>
Weddings,<br/>
Wishing wells,<br/>
And wonder,<br/>
Whispers of<br/>
Wealth,<br/>
And winding ways,<br/>
Winding along to<br/>
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Thursdays are for<br/>
Tests, time,<br/>
Temperature extremes,<br/>
And tree sitting.<br/>
For trying,<br/>
And truth,<br/>
In Thursdays.</p>

<p>Fridays are for<br/>
Fun,<br/>
And pillow fights,<br/>
And frightened parents,<br/>
Friends,<br/>
And films,<br/>
Freedom,<br/>
And French fries,<br/>
On Fridays.</p>

<p>Saturdays are for<br/>
Shopping sprees,<br/>
Shoes, stores,<br/>
And spending,<br/>
For sizing,<br/>
And sales,<br/>
And special prices,<br/>
And special Saturdays.</p>

<p>Sundays are for sleeping in,<br/>
For skating,<br/>
And skiing,<br/>
And snacking,<br/>
And swinging,<br/>
And swaying,<br/>
Spinning,<br/>
In sunlit meadows,<br/>
On Sundays.</p>
