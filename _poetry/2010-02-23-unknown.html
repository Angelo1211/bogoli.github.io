<p>Fear, a vice around my heart.<br/>
A caged bird, longs to sing.<br/>
Frightened of the open air.<br/>
Does disappointment, crushing sadness,<br/>
Lurk ahead?<br/>
Or euphoria, beyond any known?<br/>
My heart, not dares to hope,<br/>
Seeking to extinguish,<br/>
Most brutally,<br/>
The glimmer of light ahead.<br/>
Time, in endless limbo,<br/>
Crawls sluggishly along<br/>
I float<br/>
Backwardly, it seems.<br/>
Yet the dreaded day approaches,<br/>
And chill fills my soul.<br/>
Heels dig into crumbling sand,<br/>
And time lurches forward,<br/>
A horse, slapped on the flank,<br/>
Galloping off<br/>
To the edge of the cliff.<br/>
The fall, forevermore,<br/>
I want to know.<br/>
No, I donâ€™t.<br/>
Will I fly or die?</p>
