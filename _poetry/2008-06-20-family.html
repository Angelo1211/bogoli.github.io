<p>We are a unit<br/>
We are together<br/>
We are united<br/>
Maybe forever.</p>

<p>We are a shelter<br/>
The people inside<br/>
We are a coaster<br/>
Strapped in for the ride.</p>

<p>We are a plant<br/>
We are a tree<br/>
We are the roots<br/>
Just let us be.</p>

<p>We are a team<br/>
We are a squad<br/>
We are like peas<br/>
Peas in a pod.</p>

<p>We are a tribe<br/>
We are a clan<br/>
We are a group<br/>
Not simply a man.</p>

<p>When we are a group<br/>
The laughs never cease<br/>
Although it is noisy<br/>
It’s relative peace.</p>

<p>If we were a book<br/>
You’d see us all there<br/>
And from the first look<br/>
You’d see that we care.</p>

<p>We care for each other<br/>
We care for tradition<br/>
We care for our own,<br/>
And each new addition.</p>

<p>We like to love<br/>
We like to give<br/>
We are a family,<br/>
This is how we live.</p>
