<h3><em>prelude</em></h3>

<p>Exceptional, amazing.<br/>
So incredibly original.<br/>
But how can one expect less<br/>
of a masterpiece?<br/>
I think of you,<br/>
your charming, disarming, smile.<br/>
I think of you,<br/>
how your eyes shine when I laugh,<br/>
I think of you.<br/>
how you hold me, soft and gentle, so secure.<br/>
No words describe</p>

<p>the skip of my heart<br/>
when I see you<br/>
Like a stone over water,<br/>
Like a child skipping rope.<br/>
No, that can&rsquo;t be right.<br/>
It&rsquo;s more like my heart<br/>
tripped over its feet<br/>
flew to my stomach,<br/>
then jumped out of my chest,<br/>
making an orbit,<br/>
before returning,<br/>
meekly and weakly,<br/>
back to its haven in my ribs.<br/>
Still thumping erratically.</p>

<h3><em>dance</em></h3>

<p>Somehow, when I think of you,<br/>
my heart just feels just fine.<br/>
A little hyper, beating fast.<br/>
Bul still just feels just fine.<br/>
Somehow, when i see you,<br/>
My heart just feels freaked out,<br/>
and stutters and stumbles and flails.<br/>
flopping around<br/>
A fish out of water.<br/>
You&rsquo;d make a terrible cardiologist.<br/>
But you hug me just fine.<br/>
Somehow, when it&rsquo;s just me,<br/>
my poems just feel just fine.<br/>
They roll with rhythm and with beats,<br/>
I just write and feel just fine.<br/>
Somehow, when it&rsquo;s you and me,<br/>
my poems freak out and say,<br/>
there&rsquo;s no way we could fit this things.<br/>
it&rsquo;s got its own amazing way.<br/>
The beauty is that I don&rsquo;t care,<br/>
whether it fits or not<br/>
The beauty is, when I&rsquo;m with you,<br/>
I just feel just fine.<br/>
Despite everything you do to me,<br/>
Everything that&rsquo;s strange and new,<br/>
The best thing that you do<br/>
is make me feel just fine.<br/>
Sometimes I feel like crying<br/>
but you&rsquo;re always there to help<br/>
A smile, a laugh, a poke in the side,<br/>
and everything&rsquo;s just fine.<br/>
Even thought I feel just fine,<br/>
It&rsquo;s really more than that.<br/>
It&rsquo;s every way you right a wrong,<br/>
and every way you make me feel.<br/>
So more than just just fine,<br/>
I just feel like flying<br/>
like falling<br/>
like laughing<br/>
and smiling<br/>
like running<br/>
and jumping<br/>
and flipping<br/>
like screaming<br/>
and yelling<br/>
or doing whatever I feel.<br/>
That&rsquo;s the beauty of just fine.<br/>
Somehow, when I&rsquo;m with you,<br/>
I just feel just fine.<br/>
The beauty is,<br/>
with just fine,<br/>
you get just what is me.</p>
