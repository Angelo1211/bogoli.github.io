<p>Dark and mysterious<br/>
Mean and universal<br/>
in the shallows it’s calm<br/>
So it’s very diversal,<br/>
Because it can writh [sic]<br/>
and twist in the middle<br/>
It is very unpredictable<br/>
Like solving a new riddle<br/>
Being in the ocean<br/>
It feels like a bubbling<br/>
witches brew or potion<br/>
But it can be pleasant</p>
