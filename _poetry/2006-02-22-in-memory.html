<p>Sorrow soaks,<br/>
Into our heart,<br/>
Upon hearing the news,<br/>
Of the passing,<br/>
Of a wonderful person,<br/>
Beloved by all.</p>

<p>An ache spreads,<br/>
In our minds,<br/>
Numbness,<br/>
Of denial,<br/>
Denying,<br/>
What we do not wish to hear.</p>

<p>When the reality sets in,<br/>
The tears start to fall,<br/>
Tears shed in her honor,<br/>
In her memory,<br/>
Fall to the ground,<br/>
Swallowed by the thirsty earth,<br/>
Melting away,<br/>
Like the memory,<br/>
She has become.</p>

<p>She will remain with us forever,<br/>
Apart,<br/>
And yet so near,<br/>
As she resides in the stars,<br/>
And in our hearts,<br/>
And in the minds,<br/>
Of the human race,<br/>
She left behind.</p>

<p>She left an imprint,<br/>
Of love,<br/>
And happiness,<br/>
And laughter,<br/>
And she would want it to stay.</p>

<p>We loved her,<br/>
And although she is gone,<br/>
We still do.</p>
