<p>I sometimes regret it,<br/>
I sometimes feel bad,<br/>
I do it anyway,<br/>
Though it makes her feel sad.</p>

<p>I am a bully,<br/>
Though that’s not what I see,<br/>
I think I’m so cool,<br/>
But that cannot be.</p>

<p>Many times I love her,<br/>
very much indeed,<br/>
Bur if that’s true,<br/>
Why her plea I did not heed?</p>

<p>I really, truly,<br/>
Regret what I did,<br/>
It may be too late,<br/>
Though she is just a kid.</p>

<p>I push her,<br/>
and call her names,<br/>
I refuse to<br/>
Play her games.</p>

<p>I want to<br/>
fix my error,<br/>
I want her to know,<br/>
I care.</p>

<p>I don’t know<br/>
how to do it,<br/>
I’m afraid<br/>
I really bit.</p>

<p>I hope she<br/>
will forgive me,<br/>
Though I don’t<br/>
Know how it can be.</p>

<p>I need to change<br/>
My behavior, true.<br/>
I think<br/>
I got the clue.</p>

<p>So if you’re a bully,<br/>
hear me well, if you forgot,<br/>
Wounds will heal,<br/>
but words will not.</p>
