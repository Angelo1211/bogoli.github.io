<p>Only orange makes me feel<br/>
As if I were a water wheel<br/>
Turning as life goes on and on<br/>
Orange makes me want to dance<br/>
as if ants were crawling in my pants<br/>
Dancing the night away<br/>
Orange is honey toast<br/>
with flavor fit to boast<br/>
Sweet, sweet honey<br/>
Tropical birds flying high<br/>
flying high in the clear sky<br/>
Orange bold birds<br/>
Orange burns inside of me<br/>
Burning like a fire free.<br/>
A single flame, burning bright.</p>
