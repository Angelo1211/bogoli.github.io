<p>this helpless feeling<br/> like my limbs are felled trees<br/> rotting into the ground<br/> crumbling with moisture and moss<br/> roots that creep into the sinews of my muscles<br/> and break me up from the inside out<br/> .<br/> this hapless feeling<br/> like my torso has been deboned<br/> sliced oh-so-carefully down my backbone<br/> cracked at the base of my neck<br/> and pulled upward,Â <br/> slick bloody bone sliding outward<br/> ribs snapping as my organs are released with a soft <em>plop</em><br/> leaving me a spineless lump<br/> .<br/> this shiftless feeling<br/> like an elephant resting his foot on my chest<br/> oh-so-gently, nonchalantly, casually placing it there<br/> where a paradigm shift can crush me<br/> there, where my heart beats feebly<br/> begging for more life<br/> and I wait for the final blow<br/> but it never comes.</p>
