<p>you and him and me and you<br/>
a poem in three parts<br/>
it started <br/>
we smoked that one cigarette<br/>
each puffing<br/>
letting the dizziness sink in<br/>
taking us to our own little world<br/>
apart<br/>
drifting<br/>
even as I stood in the circle of your arms<br/>
I thought of him. <br/>
the way he used to hold me<br/>
the way he made love to me.<br/>
.<br/>
I thought I was over him<br/>
at least I wanted to be<br/>
but now I’m having second thoughts.<br/>
or thirds.<br/>
or fourths. <br/>
.<br/>
I wish I could block my emotions<br/>
the way I block my thoughts<br/>
pushing them out with sound waves<br/>
well<br/>
maybe not out<br/>
maybe just further in<br/>
.<br/>
but you,
you need to be extracted<br/>
like a thorn<br/>
from my heart<br/>
.<br/>
*     *     * <br/>
.<br/>
extraction:<br/>
.<br/>
at first all I wanted<br/>
was to cut you out of my life<br/>
like gangrene on a rotting limb<br/>
our relationship rotted<br/>
despite how it looked<br/>
like one of those beautiful flowers<br/>
that smells of death<br/>
.<br/>
and I did.<br/>
it was easy.<br/>
.<br/>
incision:<br/>
.<br/>
then, all I wanted<br/>
was to cut you, deep<br/>
to hurt you, the way you hurt me<br/>
or at least the way I thought you had<br/>
all you did was love too much<br/>
care too much<br/>
fall too deep<br/>
like the kindhearted person you are<br/>
you tried too hard<br/>
.<br/>
and I did.<br/>
it was not so easy.<br/>
.<br/>
amerlioration:<br/>
.<br/>
now, all I want,<br/>
is to extract your memories from my head<br/>
your stake in my heart<br/>
as painlessly as I can<br/>
but it hurts too much<br/>
and even as I look at him<br/>
I think of you<br/>
blasphemy, I know<br/>
and that it should happen now<br/>
but wounds so deep<br/>
take long to heal. <br/><br/>
*     *     *<br/><br/>
One day, I’ll be over you<br/>
I think.<br/>
I hope. <br/>
I used to think the pain would go away<br/>
but now I’m not so sure.<br/>
But it will.<br/>
It has to. <br/><br/>
It has.</p>
