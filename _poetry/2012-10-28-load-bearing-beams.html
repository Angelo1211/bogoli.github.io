<p>I’m breaking down walls<br/>
busting them open<br/>
going places I’ve never gone before<br/>
but in my rage against the man<br/>
and in my zest for life,<br/>
I tore down walls<br/>
load-bearing beams that support me<br/>
and now, painstakingly,<br/>
I must build them up again. <br/>
where is my rage and my zest now?</p>
