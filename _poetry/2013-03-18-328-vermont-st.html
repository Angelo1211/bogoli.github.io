<p>there were watermarks<br/>
rings<br/>
splotches<br/>
whiteness<br/>
on a dark table<br/>
and we were leaving<br/>
packing up<br/>
and Angela was coming in tomorrow<br/>
to check that everything was in order<br/>
or we wouldn’t get our security deposit back<br/>
although we never did<br/>
and these splotches<br/>
were the last thing<br/>
what we had been ignoring<br/>
when we were getting the tire marks off of the floor and the walls<br/>
and cleaning out our rooms<br/>
but it needed to be fixed. it was a nice table.<br/>
little fold in sides<br/>
dark wood<br/>
under a crystal chandelier that didn’t fit in and that we kept knocking with our bags<br/>
we were made too utilitarian for such a room<br/>
so we drank water and sat it down<br/>
and there were stains<br/>
then we read<br/>
that we could wet a shirt<br/>
and lay it down<br/>
over the stain<br/>
and apply an iron<br/>
wait no. not wet the shirt<br/>
just place a shirt<br/>
over the stain<br/>
and apply an iron<br/>
and the stains would disappear<br/>
and they did<br/>
we hit all of them on one side<br/>
then we showed off to the other flatmates<br/>
and then I placed the iron down<br/>
left it there to work its magic, and got distracted<br/>
the extra n minutes made a considerable difference<br/>
that we covered up<br/>
as best we could <br/>
but that didn’t stop the iron mark on the table<br/>
visible from looking at 10º from the surface<br/>
.<br/>
