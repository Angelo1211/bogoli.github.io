Oh little kitty<br/>
so dear to my heart<br/>
why have you gone?<br/>
so horribly<br/>
so painfully<br/>
You deserved to die<br/>
no pain,<br/>
Not the way you did.<br/>
The last things you saw,<br/>
Some stranger standing over you<br/>
In pain<br/>
Crushed by rubber<br/>
Coughing blood.<br/>
I should have been there<br/>
to hold you<br/>
to stroke your soft orange fur,<br/>
to let you know I love you.<br/>
Never will you walk beside me,<br/>
Tangle in my legs<br/>
purring like a lawnmower,<br/>
Oh how I loved you.<br/>
I&rsquo;m so sorry that you&rsquo;ve gone.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
My crazy orange cat.<br/>
My garfield.</p>
