<p>Been sitting here for a while.<br/>
Pencil in hand, feeling like a child.<br/>
I scribble and scratch,<br/>
Drop my head in my hands,<br/>
Drawing figures instead of pictures,<br/>
and nothing makes sense.<br/>
I tear the dot matrix paper in frustration,<br/>
and the perforations tearing bring me a brutal satisfaction.<br/>
Numbers and letters dance in my head<br/>
the tune of classical music creating a cultured soundtrack.<br/>
Time drifts away and frustration turns to panic,<br/>
I gulp coffee until it’s gone,<br/>
Frantically flipping the pages of my notes.</p>

<blockquote>If equations are trains threading the landscape of numbers, then no train stops at pi.    - Richard Preston    </blockquote>

<p>I’m gonna make that train stop at pi, God damn it.</p>
