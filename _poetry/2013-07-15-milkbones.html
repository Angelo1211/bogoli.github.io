<p>Pondering milkbones<br/>
Nosed tenderly<br/>
Nestled in mounds<br/>
Mountains, they seemed<br/>
But to him they were molehills<br/>
Milkbones might mold<br/>
Mildew and mellow <br/>
Musty and reminding<br/>
Of the time they matriculated <br/>
Under moist mounds <br/>
Maybe Bailey<br/>
Dared to hope<br/>
Instead of mourning<br/>
We&rsquo;d have his milkbones<br/>
In the morning.</p>
