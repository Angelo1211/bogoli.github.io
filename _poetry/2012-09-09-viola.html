<p>They sold my viola<br/>
to buy one for her<br/>
and now, I’m left a fiddler<br/>
with no instrument<br/>
An instrument, however,<br/>
is instrumental in playing <br/>
an instrument.<br/>
All the things I could have done,<br/>
Would have done<br/>
formed a trio<br/>
joined an orchestra<br/>
even played on the street<br/>
but they’re not to blame,<br/>
even if they did sell my viola<br/>
the truth of the matter is<br/>
I don’t know who I am, <br/>
and I cling to the people around me<br/>
hoping they’ll define me,<br/>
and I won’t have to do the work.<br/>
But that stops today<br/>
the buck stops here<br/>
whatever the hell that means.<br/>
I’m going to find out what I am<br/>
what I love<br/>
what I do<br/>
where I go<br/>
and<br/>
most<br/>
importantly<br/>
what I want.<br/>
from life<br/>
from time <br/>
from everything  <br/>
from everyone.</p>
