<p>I’m always looking<br/>
for something inspirational<br/>
and just as oblivious as I am<br/>
I wouldn’t know it until it<br/>
bitch slapped me in the face.<br/>
Here I am,<br/>
feeling inspired,<br/>
in the stale white bread town of Logan<br/>
pumping my body to some rad hip hop beats.<br/>
I believe in the healing power of garlic<br/>
and the immersion of music<br/>
and dancing so hard that my runner’s knee flares up<br/>
and I have to limp down the stairs.<br/>
Laughing at turd shaped bits of clay<br/>
who the hell thought that was a good idea?<br/>
Feeling happier than I have in a long time<br/>
in the most unexpected of places<br/>
in the most unexpected of ways<br/>
with the most unexpected of people<br/>
Thinking about dyeing my hair blond<br/>
I’d be the smartest blond in town<br/>
Thinking about wearing my glasses<br/>
for that hipster nerd look<br/>
what is with all the Jesus hair?<br/>
Nobody believes in religion anymore anyway<br/>
What the fuck is up?<br/>
Hip hop happy happy hip hop<br/>
raising me up<br/>
not like some shitty Josh Groban song<br/>
beats make me happy<br/>
thinking of people that I once admired<br/>
and thinking that I’m just like them<br/>
Only the things I want to rap about aren’t as cool<br/>
aren’t as relevant<br/>
aren’t as important.<br/>
but I don’t care, I can still rap happy<br/>
sappy <br/>
tappy my feet on the floor<br/>
why is everyone always rapping about the broken crows,<br/>
crows gnawing at hearts and darts and charts<br/>
Crow this and crow that,<br/>
I wanna rap about seagulls. <br/>
because why the hell not?</p>
