<p>the day this all began, <br/> simple, clean and cut, <br/> the lines were drawn onto the floor <br/> here is open, here is shut. </p>

<p>In firm possession of my heart, <br/> I showed you every detail <br/> every fissure <br/> every bruise <br/> every crevice <br/> every ruse <br/> and now the bomb is ticking <br/> and I can&rsquo;t find the fuse <br/> time is slipping through my fingers <br/> there&rsquo;s not much time to muse. </p>

<p>Before, you made it clear <br/> no intention of possession <br/> until today&rsquo;s confession <br/> simple burning question <br/> is this â€¦ a transgression? </p>

<p>nothing is the same again <br/> everything has changed <br/> even though we do not want, <br/> we may become estranged. </p>

<p>thoughts and doubts, <br/> they flood my head <br/> everything is new. <br/> the map has changed, <br/> the bounds are blurred, <br/> everything askew. </p>

<p>light shines from the other side, <br/> and I have nowhere to hide. <br/> what place can I inhabit <br/> if I cannot be inside? </p>

<p>Listen to my stilted rhyme <br/> And ask your spirit this: <br/> Is this where you want to go? <br/> Into the abyss? <br/> For in this place there is no hope <br/> I hope that you can see this trope <br/> And understand the true: <br/> Beyond what lives around right now, <br/> there is no me and you. </p>
