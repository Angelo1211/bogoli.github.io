<p>Rolling green hills,<br/>
A winding narrow road,<br/>
Telephone poles,<br/>
Pass my window.<br/>
The wire trails up,<br/>
Then down,<br/>
Up,<br/>
Then down again.<br/>
A stork nests,<br/>
On the pole,<br/>
Down the road,<br/>
From my favorite place.</p>

<p>A small stucco building,<br/>
Withered and old,<br/>
Patched, yet beautiful,<br/>
A large balcony,<br/>
Welcomes<br/>
The Mediterranean sun.</p>

<p>Grapevines dangle their wares,<br/>
Over the shaded porch,<br/>
A long wooden table,<br/>
Laden with food,<br/>
Smells wafting through,<br/>
The green sunlight,<br/>
That filters through<br/>
The giant leaves.</p>

<p>A scraggly meadow,<br/>
Shaded by<br/>
The crooked apple,<br/>
The patch of dirt,<br/>
And the patches of grass.</p>

<p>A small little room,<br/>
At the top of the stairs,<br/>
A dresser drawer,<br/>
Full of old torn magazines.<br/>
A faded quilt,<br/>
In a room full of<br/>
Happiness.</p>

<p>A well trodden path<br/>
Leads to a common well,<br/>
The path hard,<br/>
&amp; beaten,<br/>
The water cool,<br/>
&amp; sweet.<br/>
The Mediterranean sun,<br/>
Smiles down<br/>
At its child.<br/>
A child of the sun.</p>
