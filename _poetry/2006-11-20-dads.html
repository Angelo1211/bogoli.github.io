<p>Dads survey their yard,<br/>
While you’re almost late for school,<br/>
But definitely other than that,<br/>
They’re really quite cool.</p>

<p>They eat pistachios,<br/>
And tell you stories late at night,<br/>
They hug you when you’re cold,<br/>
And shivering with fright.</p>

<p>Dads drink their coffee,<br/>
And show you how to lay stone,<br/>
They mark your height on the wall,<br/>
To show you how much you’ve grown.</p>

<p>Dads really are the best there is,<br/>
But I know that mine’s by far the best,<br/>
I can name a million reasons,<br/>
But I think you know the rest.</p>
