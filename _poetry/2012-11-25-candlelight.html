<p>sensual silhouettes<br/> I look more beautiful<br/> as a shadow on the wall<br/> than I ever looked in person<br/> faceless.<br/>   .<br/> commonplace cotton<br/> I feel more beautiful <br/> as a sensation on a sheet<br/> than I ever felt dancing on ice<br/> graceful.<br/>   .<br/> flickering flames<br/> I sound more beautiful<br/> as soft breaths in scented air<br/> than I ever sounded in person<br/> silent.</p>
