<p>why do people put locks <br/>
on the links of chain link fences?<br/>
I want to open my window<br/>
and hear the crash of a billion snowflakes<br/>
I want to feel the circle of your arms<br/>
and the slip and slide of your skin on mine<br/>
in warm water, somewhere in the Caribbean<br/>
and doze in a hammock<br/>
with a lemonade in hand<br/>
I want to pretend to be Hemmingway<br/>
and sit in a cafe, sipping a Cuba Libre<br/>
I want to write I love you<br/>
on a napkin<br/>
and slip it your way<br/>
see your face<br/>
hope your eyes light up<br/>
like the way they do when I dance with you<br/>
I want to dance with you <br/>
in a salsa club<br/>
pulsing music and your body leading mine<br/>
to tumble into bed with you<br/>
and wake up in France, with creamy brie on my tongue, <br/>
the smell of french bread in the air, <br/>
the crackle of the crust as I break you off a piece.<br/>
I want to lay in the grass<br/>
of a field somewhere<br/>
a fleecy blanket keeping the cold out<br/>
and the heat in<br/>
as we look at the stars<br/>
and grip the blades, entwining our fingers<br/>
and holding on <br/>
so we donâ€™t fly away<br/>
except with each other.</p>
