<p>Shiny red paint<br/>
Hard and glossy to touch.</p>

<p>Shiny copper fur,<br/>
With fluffy black spots.</p>

<p>Wide black tires,<br/>
Deep gripping treads.</p>

<p>Small slender paws,<br/>
Soft little pads.</p>

<p>Black leather cushions,<br/>
Sleek and new-smelling.</p>

<p>Sinewy muscles,<br/>
Strong and defined.</p>

<p>Five hundred horses,<br/>
And yet they purr.<br/>
â€¨One throaty growl,<br/>
Speed is to come.</p>

<p>Metal hits floor,<br/>
Rubber squeals.</p>

<p>Haunches tighten and spring,<br/>
Flying forward like lightning.</p>

<p>Inhuman speed,<br/>
Wind rushing past,<br/>
Then nothing.<br/>
They are gone.</p>
