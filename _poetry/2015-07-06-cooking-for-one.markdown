Garbage bins clatter    
Squeaking brakes    
Exhaust pipes exuding     
Fridges hum     
Sweat beads on my forehead.     

I can feel the back of my thigh    
catching stickily on the maple barstool    
One side, shorts hiked up    

On the absurdly large stove,    
a relatively small pot simmers violently    
Cooking for days    
Can’t disguise    
that I’m only cooking for one.
