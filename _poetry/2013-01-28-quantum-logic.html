<p>you were just as broken as me<br/> and I left you there<br/> like a broken bottle<br/> sunken in the sand<br/> jagged edges swallowed up <br/> into wet, packed grains<br/> and the bottle looks whole.<br/>   <br/> we were kind of like that<br/> a broken bottle<br/> but not really, <br/> because we were never really whole, <br/> were we?<br/> I never thought so<br/> despite how much my heart craved<br/> it never felt whole. <br/>   <br/> I was kind of like that<br/> but I don&rsquo;t think I was ever whole<br/> or if I was, I wasn&rsquo;t shattered<br/> like a bottle<br/> more like eroded,<br/> by storms of acid rain<br/> that I thought I weathered<br/> but really, they just ate at me<br/> bit by bit,<br/> wearing me down.<br/>   <br/> we were kind of like that<br/> a spark<br/> an explosion<br/> but it fizzled out<br/> or maybe it didn&rsquo;t<br/> but I&rsquo;m too far away too tell<br/> or too blind<br/> I&rsquo;m so blind<br/>   <br/> I want to talk to you about us<br/> But you wouldn&rsquo;t want that now<br/> And that logic you&rsquo;d use on me<br/> at any other time<br/> it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.<br/> like when you try to apply newtonian physics<br/> to quantum scaled things.<br/> or maybe the other way around…<br/> I&rsquo;m those little quantum particles<br/> and I act in my own crazy way<br/> but in the real world, the big one<br/> my logic is totally fucked<br/> and my sad little particle self<br/> is alone.</p>
