<p>Hanging on a string,<br/>
This is your life,<br/>
You better be good to me,<br/>
‘Cause I’ve got the scissors,<br/>
And your life is the thread,<br/>
Stretched out in anticipation,<br/>
Of the final snip,<br/>
That ends it all.<br/>
Here you are,<br/>
And I am the guillotine,<br/>
The dropping blade<br/>
Stopped midway,<br/>
Poised on the brink of death,<br/>
Ready to fall,<br/>
To end it all.<br/>
I am in control.<br/>
I am the knife,<br/>
The pistol,<br/>
The cannon,<br/>
The grenade,<br/>
Ready to cut,<br/>
Fire,<br/>
And throw,<br/>
To end it all,<br/>
If there be reason,<br/>
To end it all…</p>
