<p>The goddess of night,<br/>
Plays with a ball of light,<br/>
While the god of day,<br/>
With darkness will play.</p>

<p>The vegetarian eating meat,<br/>
And broccoli he will not eat,<br/>
The carnivore loves tomatoes,<br/>
He traded chicken for potatoes.</p>

<p>The white man sings rap,<br/>
With his foot he will tap,<br/>
The black man records a country song,<br/>
I don’t see anything wrong.</p>

<p>A frowning man, saying hi,<br/>
Telling people, smile, says bye,<br/>
A smiling laughing woman,<br/>
Tells them they’re a cow.</p>

<p>As all the irony grows,<br/>
And everything Earth sees and knows,<br/>
People say to me,<br/>
It’s a small world, don’t you see?</p>
