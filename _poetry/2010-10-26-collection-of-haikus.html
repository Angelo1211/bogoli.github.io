<p>Hot and heavy fall <br/>
Traitors from my eyes betray <br/>
liquid pearls of wet.</p>

<p>Pain wells in my heart<br/>
Frustration burning within<br/>
Time stops for no man.</p>

<p>Lost and scared she runs,<br/>
Bewildered by the knowledge,<br/>
Stealthily eludes.</p>

<p>Trembling heart she breathes <br/>
Breeze blowing calm on her brow <br/>
She presses onward.</p>
