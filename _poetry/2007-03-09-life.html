<p>Life is a book that you write in,<br/>
Life is a diary,<br/>
A scrapbook,<br/>
A journal,<br/>
Slowly filling up with time.</p>

<p>Life is an hourglass,<br/>
A clock,<br/>
A stopwatch,<br/>
Ticking until your time is up.</p>

<p>Life is a segment,<br/>
A wedge,<br/>
A piece,<br/>
Of something more,<br/>
Something bigger, better.</p>

<p>Life is a flower,<br/>
A tree,<br/>
A bush,<br/>
Growing larger with time.</p>

<p>Life is a fruit,<br/>
An apple,<br/>
A pear,<br/>
Cultivated with timeâ€™s work.</p>

<p>Life is a piano,<br/>
A drum,<br/>
A cello,<br/>
Pulsing with the composition of time.</p>

<p>Life is a coffee,<br/>
A latte,<br/>
A cup of tea,<br/>
As you drink, time disappears.</p>

<p>Life is a playground,<br/>
A swing,<br/>
A slide,<br/>
Playing and swinging with time.</p>

<p>Life is a dream,<br/>
Of imagination,<br/>
Of knowledge,<br/>
A wisp of a shadow, not really there.</p>

<p>Life is a leaf,<br/>
Some dust,<br/>
Some dirt,<br/>
Blown away by the winds of time.</p>
