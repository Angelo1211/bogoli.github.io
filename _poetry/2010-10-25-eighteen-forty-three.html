<p>I don’t know what time it is<br/>
I’m sitting at the Starbucks<br/>
The one down Ames<br/>
Listening to the gossip babble<br/>
Of the girl parked next to me blathering on and on<br/>
to the two blond twins sitting next to her<br/>
About Charles and the dance class and her hurt knee<br/>
As the barista shouts out drinks that break through the fragile<br/>
wall of concentration in my brain like a jackhammer<br/>
while jazz blares too loud over speakers<br/>
drowned out only by the annoying ring of the<br/>
blackberries of pretentious Cambridge businessmen<br/>
How urgent is their business anyway<br/>
Ian’s hands rub soothing circles on my back<br/>
And I’m just annoyed because nothing’s working out right<br/>
But the people around me work just fine<br/>
Another woman at the long wood table<br/>
typing deliberately and oblivious to the mundane around her<br/>
even as it swallows me<br/>
I see a Jack Florey with his pink hair orders coffee just as cool as can be<br/>
Walks out not a care in the world<br/>
And I look at the smiling mermaid and think<br/>
How I wish I could be you<br/>
Instead I sit writing in deep blue ink on white paper<br/>
With perforated dotted strips and wondering where it all comes from.</p>
