<p>I cradle her in my arms, <br/> Until the thunder ceases <br/> I hold her close to me, <br/> Until the screaming wind quiets, <br/> I press her head, to my heart, <br/> and lightly stroke her hair, <br/> I breather her scent of tea, <br/> and christmas trees and strawberries, <br/> and lay until her breathing slows, <br/> quieted by the comfort of <br/> sisterhood, siblinghood, friendship, <br/> and love, <br/> Her breathing steadied, <br/> The sandman takes her, <br/> To his land of dreams and kisses, <br/> Downy quilts and slumber, <br/> Naps, dozes, and wholesome, <br/> deep deep sleep. <br/> I gently lay her down, tuck her in, <br/> Touch my lips to her forehead, <br/> comforted <br/> by the pact of sisterhood and <br/> love between us&hellip;</p>
