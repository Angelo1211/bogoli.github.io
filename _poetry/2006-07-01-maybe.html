<p>Maybe one day, <br/> I&rsquo;ll find someone <br/> to love, <br/> Maybe I&rsquo;ll be rich, <br/> famous, and a star, <br/> But then again, <br/> maybe pigs will flyâ€¦ <br/> Maybe the sun, <br/> will rise in the West, <br/> set in the east, <br/> and the wind will case to blow</p>



<p>Maybe, one day, <br/> Peace will rule us all, <br/> but then again, <br/> maybe the rain, <br/> ail fall to the sky, <br/> Rivers run uphill, <br/> and the sun, <br/> will revolve around us.</p>
