<p>We are all the same,<br/>
No, it’s not a lie.<br/>
Everyone will live,<br/>
Everyone will die.</p>

<p>We are all the same,<br/>
in many different ways.<br/>
We are all on this Earth,<br/>
For many, many days.</p>

<p>Though no one,<br/>
is quite the same,<br/>
We are all playing,<br/>
the same big game.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter,<br/>
The clothes we wear,<br/>
The way we walk,<br/>
The color of our hair.</p>

<p>People are the same,<br/>
Two eyes, one head<br/>
Two ears, one mouth<br/>
Though the color we may dread.</p>

<p>The way we live is different.<br/>
The things we do are, too.<br/>
The things we eat are also there.<br/>
Yes, that is very true.</p>

<p>We all learn important things,<br/>
Like how to read and spell.<br/>
All of us learn it,<br/>
Though some not very well.</p>

<p>We all enjoy ourselves,<br/>
In one way or another.<br/>
Maybe with a sister,<br/>
Maybe with a brother.</p>

<p>Those are just some reasons,<br/>
That we are all the same.<br/>
Some winning, some losing,<br/>
In this big, harsh, game.</p>
