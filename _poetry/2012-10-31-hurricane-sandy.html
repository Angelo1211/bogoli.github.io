<p>though elsewhere your torrential downpours <br/>
caused physical damage and pain<br/>
here, you hurricaned through<br/>
and all you left was strife<br/>
a sodden barrage of depression<br/>
blotting out hope with your clouds<br/>
my poetry sounds like shit<br/>
and that only makes me feel worse.</p>
