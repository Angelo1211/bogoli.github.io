<p>As we welcome the new year<br/>
Which is coming now and here<br/>
We will sit and sigh,<br/>
Maybe even cry,<br/>
about the things that have past<br/>
in the year here last<br/>
But new things are coming our way<br/>
Have you not nothing to say?<br/>
We will start the year with a clean slate<br/>
Not the way we are, in our present state<br/>
We will make resolutions,<br/>
To problems, create solutions<br/>
Be better next year!<br/>
So come on out and cheer,<br/>
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!<br/>
Le’s jump into the New Year’s fun!</p>
