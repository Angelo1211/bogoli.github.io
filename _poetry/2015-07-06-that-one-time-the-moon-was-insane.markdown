title: that one time the moon was insane

It hung in the sky    
not so much hung as *loomed*    
peering between the buildings    
spying through the skyline     
round, alien, and orange    
like a creme brulee    
and I gaped at it     
and I can almost smell     
its sweetness    
who torched the moon    
and made it insane?
