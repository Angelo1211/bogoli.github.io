<p>Weary bones<br/>
Tired muscles<br/>
Aching, stretching<br/>
sore, exhausted.<br/>
Energy seeps from every pore.<br/>
Blood, like sap,<br/>
gurgles through my veins<br/>
every beat of my heart<br/>
Almost more effort than I can make.<br/>
Blissful relief<br/>
as darkness slides over the field<br/>
of vision&hellip; Release.<br/>
unconsciousness.<br/>
to let go&hellip; into the ocean of dreams.</p>
