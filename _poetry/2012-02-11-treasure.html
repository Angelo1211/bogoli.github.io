<p>In the nothingness of this world,<br/>
Do you think there might be treasure?<br/>
If someone would look,<br/>
Just take a measure,<br/>
Try to find that hidden treasure&hellip;</p>

<p>Burried [sic] on an island,<br/>
Or in a stack of books,<br/>
It might take years of searching,<br/>
Or just a few looks,<br/>
Under the oldest books&hellip;</p>
