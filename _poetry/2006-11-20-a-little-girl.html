<p>A little girl,<br/>
With thick black hair,<br/>
Framing her wide, innocent face,<br/>
Framing her sad, slanting eyes,<br/>
Of the prettiest dark brown hue.<br/>
Her lips are full,<br/>
Her mouth trembles,<br/>
She cries out, in the night,<br/>
In a room full girls like her,<br/>
Cries for the mother,<br/>
That abandoned her here,<br/>
In this dreadful place,<br/>
With rags for clothes,<br/>
And next to nothing for breakfast,<br/>
With no one to hold her,<br/>
And comfort her, too,<br/>
No one to kiss her goodnight,<br/>
No one to embrace her with love,<br/>
Just a mother and father,<br/>
To say goodbye,<br/>
To leave her here,<br/>
Because she was a little girl,<br/>
A wonderful, loveable, marvelous little girl.</p>
