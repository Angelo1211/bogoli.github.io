<p>if tomorrow, say, i died<br/>
i wonder what they&rsquo;d find<br/>
the part of me that lied?<br/>
or the part that was my mind?<br/>
if i lied, and today i died,<br/>
would they know where i reside?<br/>
if not today, per se, i lied,<br/>
would they know when i decide?<br/>
the parts of me that hide,<br/>
the parts that try to lie,<br/>
which ones of those have died?<br/>
and which ones, of those, have tried?<br/>
If tried to die, and died to try<br/>
are parts of me that lied inside<br/>
did they lie inside to me to lie,<br/>
or lie to me to lie inside?<br/>
did they lie in stride<br/>
or to lie did they decide<br/>
did one decry, &ldquo;Lie, to hide!&rdquo;<br/>
or did they hide because they lied?</p>

<p>which parts of me are real?<br/>
are the parts I cannot feel?<br/>
can I even feel the real?<br/>
or reel the real to parts that feel?<br/>
maybe real resides inside<br/>
a side of me that cannot feel.<br/>
what resides inside the side<br/>
that really feels the feel?<br/>
what really does it feel?<br/>
does feeling make it real?<br/>
does the feeling of the real<br/>
become the reeling of the feel?<br/>
I kneel and feel the seal<br/>
where real and not anneal<br/>
and peel the feel of real<br/>
reveal sangreal congeal.</p>

<p>the parts of me that hide<br/>
of those, there are two kinds<br/>
those that hide me from outside<br/>
and those that hide me from my mind.<br/>
the ones that in plain sight reside<br/>
if I died, those would not mind<br/>
the ones inside, they would have tried<br/>
to save me and my mind in kind.</p>

<p>the me inside my mind has tried<br/>
to find the mind that i&rsquo;m inside<br/>
i am resigned: i don&rsquo;t decide â€“<br/>
i will not know until i died.</p>
