<p>I’ve been feeling so restless lately,<br/>
Like I want to take flight.<br/>
Here I go, running away,<br/>
When I really should stay and fight.<br/>
Fleet feet beg to be running,<br/>
and thighs are begging for pain.<br/>
Knees, screaming for weakness,<br/>
and toes that are yearning <br/>
to feel pavement<br/>
through rubber soled shoes. <br/>
An ass that protests all the sitting<br/>
and a brain that’s wandering away.<br/>
Away, away<br/>
and out to the street <br/>
where my body is yearning to be.</p>
