<p>I can’t keep a smile<br/>
from taking a seat <br/>
on my lips<br/>
this starless night<br/>
I’m feeling starlight all over me<br/>
can’t keep my head<br/>
from nodding to the beat<br/>
can’t stop my hips from swaying<br/>
or my mind from straying<br/>
(to you)<br/>
moments pass like a movie montage<br/>
can’t wait for the next reel<br/>
and it comes so fast<br/>
Good to sea you too<br/>
So this is what it feels like to be happy.<br/>
I could do with more revelations like this.</p>
