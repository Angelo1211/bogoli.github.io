<p>Nothing felt right when she left.</p>

<p>It felt strange to put one foot</p>

<p>in front of the other.</p>

<p>Strange, to feel my lungs,</p>

<p>expanding with air</p>

<p>filled with the smell of so many places.</p>

<p>Strange, to speak normally,</p>

<p>ask how long I needed to stay,</p>

<p>to loiter at this impass√©</p>

<p>Strange, to not feel her presence,</p>

<p>her calm, her spirit.</p>

<p>I tried to put on a brave face,</p>

<p>to smile, and wave, and say &ldquo;text me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t wave back</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t even turn around.</p>

<p>The phone rang</p>

<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have a chance</p>

<p>to let her know how much I love her</p>

<p>before she flew away</p>

<p>into hours of silence and sadness.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Time, how cruel and relative you are.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I miss her.</p>
