<p>beats pulse <br/>
like I’ve never heard them<br/>
and math comes through my fingers<br/>
but it starts in my brain<br/>
like I haven’t felt<br/>
in an awful long time<br/>
what was I doing to myself?<br/>
how is it that things now make sense?<br/>
Or do they? <br/>
is this what normal is? <br/>
whatever it is<br/>
I’m hoping that it never stops<br/>
because I never want to <br/>
stop<br/>
like that<br/>
again.</p>
