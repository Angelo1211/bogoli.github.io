<p>The camel has<br/>
a lumpy back<br/>
and she cannot<br/>
carry a pack</p>

<p>Though most say<br/>
she really can<br/>
carry up to 4.<br/>
Man, oh man!</p>

<p>Some people say<br/>
she doesn’t drink<br/>
water on a trip<br/>
let me think</p>

<p>No, that can’t<br/>
be true<br/>
she would die,<br/>
or get the flu</p>

<p>They say how far<br/>
she can spit<br/>
Ew, why me?<br/>
Ahhh, I quit!</p>
