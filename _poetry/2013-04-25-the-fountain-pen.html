<p>clicking randomly<br/>
so far removed<br/>
from those dreary Boston<br/>
afternoons<br/>
where rain drizzled down<br/>
leaden glass<br/>
or is it leaded?<br/>
indoubitably,<br/>
i think again<br/>
&ldquo;Look at what Bill<br/>
pulled out of his noodle&rdquo;<br/>
What?<br/>
In-doo-bitably.<br/>
I click and scroll<br/>
click and click<br/>
and somehow<br/>
I end up back  on that road<br/>
Mem Drive, they call it,<br/>
Memory Lane, I like to say.<br/>
There&rsquo;s Bill,<br/>
in pixels of black on white<br/>
in serifed fonts<br/>
of published books<br/>
that no longer smell of paper pulp<br/>
and reek, instead<br/>
of plastic<br/>
and dust<br/>
that&rsquo;s gathered,<br/>
not of age,<br/>
but of static<br/>
electro<em>static</em><br/>
yet constantly changing<br/>
and in the constant change,<br/>
there&rsquo;s Bill,<br/>
on Sarah&rsquo;s page<br/>
right next to Rex,<br/>
and people I&rsquo;ve never met<br/>
but there he is.<br/>
And I&rsquo;m struck.<br/>
By how much change<br/>
he weathered<br/>
and how much change<br/>
he struck.<br/>
(he wouldn&rsquo;t have like that,<br/>
the struck and the struck<br/>
but to think of a word that worked,<br/>
no such luck.)</p>

<p>I read Sarah&rsquo;s words<br/>
and admire her style.<br/>
her flair, her zest<br/>
read her poems in my head<br/>
taking the rest<br/>
the break, the pause<br/>
that Bill taught me<br/>
poems take their time,<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know if he said<br/>
but I imagine he did<br/>
hearing myself read aloud<br/>
in my head.<br/>
I am a poem<br/>
I took my time<br/>
still taking it,<br/>
who am I taking it from?<br/>
These musings,<br/>
they ramble<br/>
even now, your time, I&rsquo;ve taken.<br/>
A point remains to be made.<br/>
Some people are ink<br/>
on white paper pulp<br/>
imprinted, imprinting<br/>
lengthily lingering<br/>
some people are pulses<br/>
on digital screens<br/>
screened out<br/>
as statically analog<br/>
Bill is black ink<br/>
he&rsquo;d read this and wink<br/>
but today,<br/>
when glasses clink<br/>
Of Bill and his pen<br/>
I&rsquo;ll think.</p>

<p><em>thanks to Sarah for the inspiration</em><br/><em>and to Bill for everything.</em></p>
