<p>Raindrops fall like tears,<br/>
Falling from the sky<br/>
For the events of today<br/>
Had made me want to cry.</p>

<p>As I stare up above<br/>
Staring at the sky<br/>
The sky matches my feelings,<br/>
My feelings of cry.</p>

<p>As I cry so hard,<br/>
Gazing at the sky,<br/>
I don’t cry alone,<br/>
for I’m crying with the sky.</p>
