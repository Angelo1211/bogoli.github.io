<p>Every time I think I&rsquo;m healing<br/>
I cry again <br/>
And I try to decipher what&rsquo;s wrong<br/>
And all the hurt just keeps pouring out<br/>
Maybe these headaches I get<br/>
Maybe the vice around my temples<br/>
Is holding me together,<br/>
Keeping me from shattering<br/>
Ugh that&rsquo;s so clich√©<br/>
&ldquo;Shattering&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;Breaking&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so broken&rdquo;. <br/>
How about splintered?<br/>
I&rsquo;m splintered. Bits of me are falling off<br/>
Hurting others as they go<br/>
Burying deep into flesh like tiny knives<br/>
Leaving me &hellip; Unfinished <br/>
In need of a good sanding<br/>
A good scrubbing<br/>
I keep looking for a baptism<br/>
But what is being reborn an atheist?<br/>
I can keep looking and looking<br/>
But there&rsquo;s nothing more out there.<br/>
Back to the point<br/>
The point of the splinters<br/>
The point of my poem<br/>
I need to un-wedge this cork<br/>
Bottle between my knees,<br/>
Fingers wrapped around the neck<br/>
Thumbs pushing with all their might<br/>
So much strength in me<br/>
And that&rsquo;s all I can use. <br/>
Listening to the same songs over and over<br/>
I&rsquo;m stuck like a dried out cork<br/>
Someone stored me wrong <br/>
Upside down<br/>
And now, a perfectly good bottle of wine, ruined. <br/>
Uncork me.</p>
