<p>god is not in the stained glass<br/>
of an old and musty church<br/>
god is not in the worn wood<br/>
of an ancient antique cross<br/>
got is not in the bible,<br/>
nor in any other book<br/>
god is not there.<br/>
do not seek him there.</p>

<p>god is in each life,<br/>
Seek him there instead.<br/>
god is in the flame,<br/>
of a candle for the dead,<br/>
god is in the laughter,<br/>
of a happy child at play,<br/>
god is in the sunrise,<br/>
in the breaking of the day,<br/>
god is in the sea,<br/>
in each and every wave,<br/>
god is in the echo,<br/>
of a footstep in a cave,<br/>
god is in the wing,<br/>
of an eagle flying high,<br/>
god is in the sand,<br/>
of a dune, so tall, hot and dry,<br/>
god is in the slam,<br/>
of an old screen door, i’m home,<br/>
god is in the tears,<br/>
you cry when you’re alone,<br/>
god is in the trees,<br/>
each quaking leaf they hold,<br/>
god is in the memories,<br/>
we share when we are old,<br/>
god is in the words,<br/>
of an ordinary note,<br/>
god is in the wind,<br/>
filling the sail of the boat,<br/>
god is in the painting,<br/>
the one hung on the wall,<br/>
god is in our wounds,<br/>
in every time we fall,<br/>
god is in the joy,<br/>
we feel with those we love.<br/>
god is in the olive branch,<br/>
in the beak of a dove,<br/>
god is everything around us,<br/>
if you look hard you will see,<br/>
everything that god is,<br/>
everything we can be.</p>
