<p>There&rsquo;s just something about the way<br/>
those jeans fit and feel.<br/>
That comfy blue denim,<br/>
the worn in, familiar feel.<br/>
Like someone poured me into them.<br/>
Like they were crafted just for me.<br/>
My legs sheathed in cotton.<br/>
I can conquer the world.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know how Alexander the Great<br/>
managed without a pair.<br/>
The threadbare spot spots that wear out,<br/>
Indigo wash fading a touch,<br/>
But still my trusty denim blues<br/>
clad my bare behind.</p>
