<p>One day I woke up<br/>
Rolled out of bed,<br/>
And onto the floor.<br/>
Hit my head,<br/>
Hard on the ground,<br/>
&amp; I knew,<br/>
Today was Monday,<br/>
Today was to be<br/>
A bad day.</p>

<p>The sky was dark,<br/>
&amp; cloudy,<br/>
Rain was on the way,<br/>
The one thing I didn’t need.<br/>
It looked like hell<br/>
Outside,<br/>
The world was against me,<br/>
I just knew,<br/>
I knew it was a<br/>
Bad day.</p>

<p>I missed the bus,<br/>
Waited in the rain,<br/>
Pouring buckets over my sorry head,<br/>
The next bus came,<br/>
Fifteen minutes late,<br/>
Missed the bus after that,<br/>
Said what the hell,<br/>
It’s a bad day anyway,<br/>
Can’t get much worse.</p>

<p>Fire drills and essays,<br/>
Nasty teachers,<br/>
And angry parents,<br/>
Close the door,<br/>
To the world,<br/>
Lock yourself away,<br/>
To deal with your<br/>
Bad day.<br/>
Turn up the music<br/>
So loud it hurts,<br/>
Let the music blast away<br/>
Your bad day<br/>
It could always be worse.</p>
