<p>Weariness, greedy and alone,<br/>
Settles into the bones,<br/>
It seeps into joints,<br/>
Leeching into muscle<br/>
Until movement becomes an arduous ordeal.<br/>
It saps the strength, the determination,<br/>
The will to continue.<br/>
Consumes the courage<br/>
So carefully constructed.<br/>
It does not march,<br/>
Does not decimate,<br/>
Does not erase you into oblivion.<br/>
Perhaps it would be better.<br/>
Instead, it nibbles at the foundation,<br/>
Weakening from within,<br/>
Coerced into defeat,<br/>
You crumple to your knees.<br/>
Take me, take me.<br/>
But exhaustion does not kill your body.<br/>
You trudge on,<br/>
The death march of life,<br/>
Time, beating out the days.<br/>
Boom. Boom. Boom.<br/>
Your spirit broken,<br/>
Its slumped shrunken form,<br/>
Fades on the road behind.</p>
