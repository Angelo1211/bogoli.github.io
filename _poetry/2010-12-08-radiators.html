<p>Above, I hear the sounds<br/>
of workmens&rsquo; boots and clanking<br/>
of radiator pipes as they are <br/>
knocked, and pounded into place.<br/>
The sounds resonate, through the <br/>
yellow walls, with the sponging<br/>
the ones painted by the architect<br/>
the ones with the white trim<br/>
and lavender panel. <br/>
They shake the poster of Salvador Dali&rsquo;s<br/>
Swans reflecting elephants<br/>
and I hear the buzzing of the paper<br/>
They shake me from sleep<br/>
and I fight it, enveloped in <br/>
warm clouds, the blue and green<br/>
comfort, green side up,<br/>
and I press my nose between<br/>
your back and the sheets<br/>
and pull the covers up.<br/>
Another day has greeted me,<br/>
each more rudely as the next<br/>
as I sit, passing time, unwisely,<br/>
Day after day after day</p>
