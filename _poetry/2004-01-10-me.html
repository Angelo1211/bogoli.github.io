<p>I am me<br/>
me is I<br/>
I can talk<br/>
but I can’t fly</p>

<p>I am good<br/>
at many things<br/>
what you want<br/>
I will brings</p>

<p>I like fruits<br/>
the color yellow<br/>
pasta and steak<br/>
and raspberry Jell-o</p>

<p>Math is great<br/>
English better<br/>
like air is dry<br/>
and water wetter</p>

<p>Green is favored<br/>
unlike blue<br/>
the green macaw<br/>
took off and flew</p>

<p>Family includes<br/>
mother, dad,<br/>
me and sister<br/>
that’s not bad</p>

<p>Sleep is loved<br/>
so is food<br/>
Favorites change<br/>
and so does mood</p>

<p>Crafts are fun<br/>
but building is more<br/>
somethings are not<br/>
and they are a chore</p>

<p>That is all<br/>
I have to tell<br/>
goodbye, good luck<br/>
I wish you well!</p>
