<p>I wonder why,<br/>
The world is round,<br/>
The sun is round,<br/>
The horizon is round.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
The stars that shine,<br/>
Blink in the sky,<br/>
And fall.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
People die,<br/>
Leave the empty body,<br/>
Take with them their life and spirit,<br/>
Leave the shell that harbored it.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
People cry,<br/>
Glistening pearls of despair,<br/>
Rolling from puffy, swollen eyes,<br/>
Full of sorrow,<br/>
Full of tears,<br/>
That fall,<br/>
One by one.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
The thistle grows,<br/>
To poke, tear, and prod,<br/>
To pain and rip the skin,<br/>
To stick its thorn,<br/>
 In your flesh<br/>
To draw blood,<br/>
In your hand.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
Sorrow is real,<br/>
When it is not necessary,<br/>
Not needed<br/>
Not wanted.<br/>
I wonder why,<br/>
Pain is here,<br/>
For us to bear,<br/>
Prickling needles of it,<br/>
Stabs, aches and throbs of it.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
The moon still shines,<br/>
The sun still shines,<br/>
The stars still shine.</p>

<p>I wonder why,<br/>
Despite the grief,<br/>
The pain, the sorrow,<br/>
The moon still shines,<br/>
The sun still shines,<br/>
The stars still shine.</p>
