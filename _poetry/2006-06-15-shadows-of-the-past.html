<p>When I saw the prairie,<br/>
I heard the creak and groan,<br/>
White covered wagons.<br/>
When I saw the prairie grass,<br/>
Rippling in the westward wind,<br/>
I saw ghostly footprints,<br/>
Through the parted stalks.</p>

<p>When I saw the forest,<br/>
I heard the men sawing,<br/>
The deafening thud of crashing trees.<br/>
When I saw the pine trees,<br/>
I saw a silhouette,<br/>
A beaver skin cap,<br/>
Amongst the evergreens.</p>

<p>When I saw the sea,<br/>
I heard the wind snap the sails,<br/>
The rigging trembling in the gale.<br/>
When I saw the waves.<br/>
I saw a vessel,<br/>
True and proud,<br/>
In the midst of the spraying foam.</p>
