<p>Classical music trickles out of mediocre quality speakers,<br/>
barely enough volume to cover the buzzing of the mini fridge.<br/>
Behind me, the ghostly limbs of trees,<br/>
illuminated orange from fluorescent building lights,<br/>
blend with my reflection in the darkened window.<br/>
Before me, blue lines checker a pristine white paper,<br/>
a mechanical pencil sits ready.<br/>
Problems, with their graceful curves and foreign figures,<br/>
spread in front of me, black stark against white, and my heart pounds.<br/>
The graphite copies a problem down, grey less harsh than black,<br/>
and gears begin to click in my head. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.<br/>
against the paper. Little xâ€™s fit in boxes.<br/>
A few lines later, and the problem lays unraveled,<br/>
torn down, vanquished, and conquered.<br/>
I breathe a sigh of relief,<br/>
and the knot in my stomach releases its hold on my nerves,<br/>
just a touch.</p>
