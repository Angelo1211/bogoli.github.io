<p>well<br/>
not quite<br/>
but the Mark Knopfler song plays in my head<br/>
and I can’t get past the chorus<br/>
I don’t know it well enough<br/>
it was my dad’s song, anyway<br/>
3:19 sounds close enough<br/>
I’m reminded of times<br/>
when Mark Knopfler was part of the band<br/>
and he played from speakers near my head<br/>
quietly blasting guitar solos in my ears<br/>
as my head bobbed with the turns<br/>
and my forehead knocked against the window<br/>
and we all drove somewhere together<br/>
to see the world.<br/>
The world has changed<br/>
as it always does.<br/>
Gone are the days of the Sultans of Swing<br/>
of Tequila Sunrise<br/>
and Duke of Earl.<br/>
Paul and Paula no longer croon their songs<br/>
from an old cassette tape<br/>
as we drive through canyons<br/>
and on freeways.<br/>
Gone are the people<br/>
that drove in that car together.<br/>
What now?</p>
