<p>If files held dust like archives did,<br/>
I&rsquo;d blow it off like clouds of old,<br/>
to show you what I used to write,<br/>
and what this binary holds.</p>

<p>Today I found these floppy disks,<br/>
in a bin, in the garage,<br/>
and punching in the little square,<br/>
it seemed like a mirage.</p>

<p>The folders, there they were,<br/>
all stacked up like before,<br/>
the icons yellowed, 8-bit<br/>
just like the days of yore.</p>

<p>The sound it made, so strange<br/>
Since I heard it, it&rsquo;d been years<br/>
A whine, a groan, a kind of roar,<br/>
it did nothing for my fears.</p>

<p>But there, in the window<br/>
I saw the files and folder,<br/>
these poems, they&rsquo;re mine,<br/>
Yes, but so much older.</p>

<p>Nine years since little fingers,<br/>
on Compaq keyboards clack,<br/>
and now all I can think of,<br/>
is how to get them back.</p>
