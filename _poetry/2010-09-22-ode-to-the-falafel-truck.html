<p>Your grimy black tires<br/>
that have driven<br/>
through beautiful Boston streets,<br/>
sit parked<br/>
on the<br/>
Avenue<br/>
of Massachusetts,<br/>
Supporting your great steel underbelly.<br/>
Pipes and hoses,<br/>
Gears and axels adorn your underside,<br/>
A dark, messy tangle that keeps you<br/>
Alive.<br/>
Decals emblazon your flat white sides,<br/>
Cracked and slightly faded,<br/>
Trumpeting your wares to the city.<br/>
A heavenly smell fills your boxy belly,<br/>
Seeping, pouring out of your<br/>
ticket-counter-like window.<br/>
You rumble and groan<br/>
each day at lunch time<br/>
A delightful harmony<br/>
of the roar and growl in my tummy.<br/>
Ten minutes with you,<br/>
a tango of sorts,<br/>
and my life has been made complete once more.</p>
