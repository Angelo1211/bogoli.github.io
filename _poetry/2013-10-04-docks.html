<p>Someone stuck my feet<br/>
in big concrete blocks<br/>
before I snuck a glance<br/>
they locked<br/>
I dropped<br/>
Bones popped<br/>
But still my feet were stuck.<br/>
I tried to lay<br/>
to sit and stay<br/>
But legs don&rsquo;t bend that way<br/>
I tried to turn<br/>
into an urn<br/>
to walk, to sink<br/>
these concrete blocks into the sea<br/>
But see, I think, from what I&rsquo;ve learned<br/>
Those concrete blocks were heavy<br/>
and no matter how I tried to levy<br/>
The strength I had was naught<br/>
even less than what I thought<br/>
And all I did was was stand<br/>
Not grand,<br/>
In the middle of the land<br/>
I couldn&rsquo;t go, not any way,<br/>
and there I had to stay.<br/>
feet in rocks, no socks<br/>
so close to docks<br/>
where I could sail away.</p>
