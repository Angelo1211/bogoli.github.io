<p>A mother’s touch,<br/>
and a mother’s embrace,<br/>
are matched by no other,<br/>
the gentleness,<br/>
and love,<br/>
that fills a mother’s carress [sic],<br/>
is overwhelming,<br/>
in it’s [sic] effect.<br/>
A mother’s care,<br/>
always welcome,<br/>
warms you up<br/>
inside,<br/>
For a mother’s smiles,<br/>
are always real.<br/>
A mother’s arms,<br/>
are meant for holding,<br/>
and protecting,<br/>
a mother’s kiss,<br/>
soothing<br/>
and tranquill [sic],<br/>
The love<br/>
between mother,<br/>
and child,<br/>
unbreakable,<br/>
for maternal love,<br/>
is eternal.</p>
