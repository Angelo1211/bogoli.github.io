<p>A little green person<br/>
Pokes his head<br/>
Through the cover<br/>
Of dark brown soil.<br/>
He greedily soaks up the sun,<br/>
And the rain<br/>
Nourishes<br/>
Its budding youth.</p>

<p>The little green person<br/>
Frees his arms.<br/>
His head grows,<br/>
Brimming with knowledge,<br/>
As it splits,<br/>
A small white flower<br/>
Pokes out<br/>
And hails the sun<br/>
In salutation.</p>

<p>The little green man<br/>
Is strong.<br/>
Strong sun rays<br/>
Bathe it<br/>
In warm nurture.</p>

<p>The little green man<br/>
Gulps in the air,<br/>
And the water.<br/>
His head is full of blooms.<br/>
His arms reach<br/>
 Stretched to the sky,<br/>
And his feet are<br/>
Firmly planted<br/>
In the soil.<br/>
He reaches for the sun.<br/>
Spring has come.</p>
