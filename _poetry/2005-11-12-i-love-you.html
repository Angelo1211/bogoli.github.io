<p>I love you’s aren’t said with words,<br/>
They are shown to the receiver through action,<br/>
The actions show them that you care,<br/>
Those are the laws of attraction.</p>

<p>I love you’s don’t mean a thing,<br/>
When they are naked without deeds,<br/>
With nothing else to go with them,<br/>
That’s not what anyone needs.</p>

<p>You’re my special person,<br/>
And since you’re the best, too,<br/>
I wrote you this poem,<br/>
To say that “I love you”.</p>
