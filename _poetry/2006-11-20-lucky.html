<p>Thereâ€™s a little kitty,<br/>
He is my lifelong friend,<br/>
He was black in appearance,<br/>
With little white paws,<br/>
A round little face,<br/>
With two round brown eyes,<br/>
I understood him quite well,<br/>
Almost like he talked,<br/>
He loved me,<br/>
And I love him.<br/>
He purred like a lion,<br/>
A great trembling roar,<br/>
Almost deafening, it was.<br/>
Kept me awake, all night long,<br/>
Then it annoyed me,<br/>
But now I miss it.<br/>
Lucky was lucky,<br/>
But he not always won,<br/>
The fights that he sought,<br/>
All night long.<br/>
One night he came back,<br/>
Wounded and sore,<br/>
With a shoulder infected,<br/>
And lay down on the floor.<br/>
We woke up one morning,<br/>
And found he was gone,<br/>
He left us to mourn,<br/>
Us unlucky Lucky owners.<br/>
And now as I think,<br/>
Of Lucky my cat,<br/>
I remember his purring,<br/>
His soft little head.<br/>
His torn ear,<br/>
And the red bandana he wore,<br/>
I remember the good times,<br/>
And some of the bad,<br/>
And all the things that Lucky taught me.<br/>
Although I miss him,<br/>
I know he is gone,<br/>
Gone away from me,<br/>
Out of reach,<br/>
But he will always stay,<br/>
In my heart.</p>
