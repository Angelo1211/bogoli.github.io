<p>A sign of courage,<br/>
is noticeable anywhere<br/>
at September 11th,<br/>
in New York, over there<br/>
while towers tumble,<br/>
to take action<br/>
just to bring<br/>
a smile of satisfaction<br/>
to a little girl<br/>
with two eyes so blue<br/>
to take action under pressure<br/>
means you have courage<br/>
TRUE</p>
