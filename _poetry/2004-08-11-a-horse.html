<p>In the distance of the mountain plains,<br/>
A galloping was heard,<br/>
In the dead of night, full moon,<br/>
A galloping was heard.<br/>
It drew away, got softer,<br/>
The galloping was hear.</p>

<p>In the misty twilight darkness,<br/>
A soft shadow was seen,<br/>
In the sunset fog tonight,<br/>
A soft shadow was seen,<br/>
The shadow gradually disappeared,<br/>
The softer shadow seen.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the dew,<br/>
A wilder herd was smelled,<br/>
In the motionless evening,<br/>
A wilder herd was smelled,<br/>
It moved away with the wind,<br/>
The wilder herd was smelled.</p>

<p>In the black and white today,<br/>
A horse’s fear was felt,<br/>
In the mountains on a ranch,<br/>
A horse’s fear was felt,<br/>
As calm set in, the fear was gone<br/>
The horse’s fear was felt.</p>
