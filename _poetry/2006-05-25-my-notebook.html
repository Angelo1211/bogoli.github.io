<p>A notebook holds my soul,<br/>
The pencil fills it up,<br/>
With thoughts and songs, and poems.<br/>
I write and write and write,<br/>
To fill my soul,<br/>
And empty my mind.</p>

<p>I fill the pages,<br/>
With scribbles and scrawls,<br/>
With drawings and diagrams,<br/>
And lists.<br/>
I fill the pages,<br/>
‘Till they can take no more,<br/>
Then I write around the edges,<br/>
And sign my name at the bottom.</p>

<p>I write ‘till the moon shines,<br/>
Overhead,<br/>
Lighting the pages,<br/>
Overflowing with words,<br/>
With feelings, emotions, and poems,<br/>
With stories and sunsets,<br/>
And the wars of the world,<br/>
Pages and pages,<br/>
Of people and things,<br/>
Flowers and doves,<br/>
And oceans and seas.</p>

<p>And I write ‘till I can’t,<br/>
‘Till my arm is bursting,<br/>
With pain, effort, and all the things,<br/>
In my notebook</p>

<p>My notebook is full,<br/>
Full to the covers,<br/>
Everywhere is scribbled on,<br/>
Written on, with the words<br/>
Of my soul.<br/>
I have to find a new one,<br/>
And start over,<br/>
And write about anything,<br/>
And everything,<br/>
In poems, scribbles and scrawls,<br/>
In drawings, diagrams and lists.<br/>
I’ll write ‘till I fill that one up,<br/>
Full to the covers,<br/>
Then I’ll start over,<br/>
With a blank notebook.</p>

<p>My notebook.</p>
