<p>Soft worn nose and button eyes,<br/>
Patchy fur and missing stuffing<br/>
A torn ear,<br/>
And a flattened paw,<br/>
Perfect for holding.<br/>
A special smell,<br/>
Soothing to snuggle,<br/>
A missing tail,<br/>
And a lopsided grin,<br/>
Smiles at me funny.<br/>
The eyes look at me,<br/>
Knowingly,<br/>
Knowing and remembering.<br/>
The secret adventures,<br/>
They shared with me.<br/>
The eyes of a veteran,<br/>
An ancient companion,<br/>
A veteran of the life of<br/>
A thumb suckerâ€™s pet.<br/>
All the things<br/>
That might be wrong with this bear,<br/>
Are what make him my<br/>
Perfect<br/>
Teddy bear</p>
