<p>Sometimes this stupid mind of mine<br/>
doesn&rsquo;t know where to draw the line<br/>
I&rsquo;m sorry that this anger, flaming,<br/>
fuels me to run crazy, blaming,<br/>
because when it&rsquo;s flames I throw,<br/>
no one gets close enough to know<br/>
how loneliness eats me up inside<br/>
how demons in my heart reside<br/>
each day I strive and strive to hide,<br/>
and vow to change, unlike the tide<br/>
but like the tide, such is my pride<br/>
it comes and goes and stays inside.<br/>
You know why I pretend to be<br/>
shrouded in such mystery.<br/>
because really, all that&rsquo;s left of me,<br/>
is bitter, stale transparency.<br/>
Yet when I look into glass<br/>
all I see is mirror and ass<br/>
sometimes that&rsquo;s all I ever see,<br/>
that&rsquo;s what I think is left of me,<br/>
After melancholy wrecks,<br/>
there&rsquo;s nothing left for me but sex.<br/>
Ugly&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve never heard,<br/>
and so at times, I have preferred<br/>
to retreat inside of me, I chose,<br/>
to stop my life and come to blows.<br/>
The kind with tongues and teeth.<br/>
When a sweaty body, I&rsquo;m beneath<br/>
It&rsquo;s another shield I&rsquo;ve found<br/>
and the possibilities abound.<br/>
My mind runs free<br/>
and suddenly,<br/>
I&rsquo;m protected once more<br/>
as protected as a whore.</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re the only one that&rsquo;s ever seen<br/>
the reason why I&rsquo;m truly mean<br/>
and there under my pillow<br/>
my dagger I had hidden<br/>
You took it when I wasn&rsquo;t looking<br/>
and while one day I was hooking,<br/>
You lodged it where you knew me best<br/>
in my soft heart inside my chest.<br/>
And now, each breath I take,<br/>
I think of you, you&rsquo;re in the ache.<br/>
and I know, Caesar, that I stabbed you first,<br/>
and that&rsquo;s the pain that hurts the worst.</p>
