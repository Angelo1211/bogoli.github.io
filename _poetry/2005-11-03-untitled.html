<p>When my life is not going right,<br/>
I immerse myself,<br/>
In music,<br/>
Like the way I immerse myself,<br/>
In tears.<br/>
Whether I play it,<br/>
Or listen to it,<br/>
I let it fill my soul,<br/>
Take me to is’ harbor,<br/>
It’s haven of safety.<br/>
I let the music,<br/>
Overtake me,<br/>
Wrap me in its soothing tones,<br/>
‘Till the black cloud,<br/>
Overpasses.<br/>
It shelters me,<br/>
Through the storm,<br/>
That is my tears,<br/>
Through the thunder,<br/>
That is my sobs,<br/>
It waits ‘till the sky clears,<br/>
Then releases me,<br/>
From its spell.<br/>
But sometimes I don’t want to,<br/>
I don’t want to leave,<br/>
Don’t want to leave<br/>
The safety,<br/>
Of its arms,<br/>
As it holds me to the notes,<br/>
That soothe my aching heart.<br/>
And I don’t leave.<br/>
I stay ‘till I am music,<br/>
Comforting lost souls,<br/>
Lost souls like myself.</p>
