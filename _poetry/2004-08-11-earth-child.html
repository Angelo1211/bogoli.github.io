<p>This is that land of the<br/>
Earth Child<br/>
Born so free<br/>
and wild<br/>
It swims in the<br/>
river deep<br/>
It climbs up cliffs<br/>
so steep.<br/>
It resides in trees<br/>
that sway<br/>
On a quiet<br/>
breezy day.<br/>
But when you awaken<br/>
its ire<br/>
The wind in its<br/>
clamorous choir<br/>
will ring in<br/>
your ear<br/>
while it gives you<br/>
a hideous sneer.<br/>
This is the land<br/>
of the Child of Earth,<br/>
Giving you death,<br/>
Giving you birthâ€¦</p>
