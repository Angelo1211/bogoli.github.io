<p>When I think of him,<br/>
My heart skips a beat,<br/>
A jolt of electricity<br/>
Running through my veins,<br/>
Pulsing,<br/>
Tingling,<br/>
Making my heart<br/>
Flip flop in my giddy chest,<br/>
Every time my thoughts stray<br/>
To him.</p>

<p>There’s a frog,<br/>
A little frog nestled in my stomach,<br/>
And it jumps,<br/>
Every time I think of him.<br/>
It seems like my body won’t listen to me.<br/>
My eyes search for him in the crowd,<br/>
My mind wanders to him in the darkness<br/>
My arms long to wrap around him.<br/>
Every time my thoughts drift<br/>
Toward him,<br/>
The rest of me<br/>
Doesn’t listen.</p>

<p>My mind and my heart<br/>
Say two different things.<br/>
My mind says,<br/>
Go to him,<br/>
My heart says,<br/>
Run to him,<br/>
Hurry,<br/>
Faster.<br/>
My feet walk in his direction,<br/>
No matter where he is,<br/>
Whenever I think<br/>
Of him.</p>
