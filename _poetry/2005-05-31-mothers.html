<p>Mothers smile,<br/>
and mothers care,<br/>
A mother’s love,<br/>
is always there,<br/>
Through the good times<br/>
and the bad,<br/>
When you’re happy,<br/>
mad, or sad,<br/>
A mother is a guide,<br/>
A teacher and a friend,<br/>
A crying shoulder,<br/>
Until the end<br/>
No matter what,<br/>
A mother loves you,<br/>
with her whole heart,<br/>
She doesn’t care what you do.<br/>
She loves you.</p>
