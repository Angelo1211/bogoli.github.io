The elevator smells like a cheap motel    
not that there's something that an elevator    
should smell like    
just something that it shouldn't    
    
The coffee reeks of cheapness     
Dank sweat permeates the hallways    
Corridors that smell of basement and mold    
    
Barely filtered over conditioned air    
masks the smell of one too many catered asian    
meals waft around    
someone's food truck muck    
    
I try not to     
breathe    
    
I miss the smell of the rain on the pavement    
The sharp sting, icy smell of fresh snow    
I miss the wet tang of spring thaw    
and even the heavy bite of diesel     
I miss the smell of barbeques, fat dripping on charcoals,    
and the burning musk leaves of fall    
Fresh mown lawn smell    
staining the inside of your nose    
    
Here everything smells like a stain.
