<p>Hold your tears, till they fall,<br/>
Glittering pearls of despair,<br/>
Hold your sobs, till they burst,<br/>
Burst forth from your chest,<br/>
like wounded doves,<br/>
breaking free from the prison,<br/>
of body and soul.<br/>
Flying with the uneven beat,<br/>
of torn wings,<br/>
betraying<br/>
your misery to the outside world.<br/>
The white dove, crimson blood,<br/>
Dripping through downy feathers,<br/>
Like tears fall from your face,<br/>
Down, down they fall, trickling down,<br/>
Down your chin, where they lie in wait,<br/>
for the perfect moment to drop<br/>
Just like your spirit and soul,<br/>
Racked by sobs like a flying,<br/>
wounded doveâ€¦</p>
