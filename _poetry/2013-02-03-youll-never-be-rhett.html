<p>God damn it<br/> I’m Scarlet fucking O’Hara<br/> Didn’t think it would feel like this<br/> is this what I wanted all along?<br/> I wanted someone to call me baby not darling, with a sneer<br/> then it started dawning on me<br/> It came a little too little<br/> A little too late<br/> And then dawn shined down on me some more<br/> Thank god for that nearly endless ball of burning helium<br/> And the way it touched my mind<br/> And I realized it’s true<br/> You’re not my Rhett Butler<br/> Though there might be a little of Scarlett in me,<br/> There’s a little bit more of me<br/> That gave me hope<br/> Not to mope<br/> It’s a better isotope this way<br/> the way I see it now,<br/> Anyway. <br/> It’s not too little<br/> And it’s not too late.</p>
