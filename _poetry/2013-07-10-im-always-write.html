<p>Some people, they, are born to run<br/>
But, baby, that&rsquo;s not me.<br/>
Of all the things under the sun<br/>
Writing, I was born to be.</p>

<p>That curse that they all talk about<br/>
It&rsquo;s one I want to have, I swear<br/>
there&rsquo;s nothing more, I want to shout,<br/>
than to be rhyming everywhere.</p>

<p>Sometimes I trip over my feet,<br/>
On pretty, nice, flat land.<br/>
When my poor face and pavement meet,<br/>
No pen is in my hand.</p>

<p>On the days I have good luck,<br/>
For me, that often means,<br/>
Lustrous, gold words, I have struck<br/>
I&rsquo;m one of the machines!</p>

<p>Forever, I will always be<br/>
—It&rsquo;s meant to be, I say—<br/>
A writer sheathed in mystery<br/>
That is the only way.</p>
