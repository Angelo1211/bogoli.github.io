<p>White fresh powder<br/>
Soars through crisp, alpine air,<br/>
Brilliant, faceted crystals,<br/>
Refracting the light,<br/>
Of a white sun.<br/>
Thin, metal-edged slats,<br/>
Through feather-light snow cut<br/>
Leave chaos in their wake<br/>
The pristine, undisturbed snow<br/>
Parted like water.<br/>
Metal columns, stand,<br/>
Like artificial trees,<br/>
Casting shadows on the snow.<br/>
Cables, tight with excitement<br/>
Carry impatient skiers<br/>
Up the slope.<br/>
Excitement builds<br/>
At the crest of the hill.<br/>
Skis glide over packed snow,<br/>
And swish as they stop.<br/>
Looking over the edge,<br/>
Where tall black pines<br/>
Frame a run of snow,<br/>
The air, muffled by the snow,<br/>
Bitingly cold,<br/>
As the sun warms your face.<br/>
Rock forward, skis tip,<br/>
Savor the moment.<br/>
Past the fulcrum,<br/>
The weight slowly shifts,<br/>
Exhilaration<br/>
Begins</p>
