<p>An unexplored territory<br/>
unknown to human mind,<br/>
A perfect contribution<br/>
to a harassed humankind<br/>
What will happen<br/>
if this gift<br/>
is taken away?<br/>
Where will that life<br/>
that kept us high go?<br/>
It will disappear<br/>
and the world will fill with<br/>
FEAR OF WAR<br/>
That is where peace comes in.</p>
