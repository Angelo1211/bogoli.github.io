The barista is frazzled    
or at least I would be    
he looks just dazed    
pouring milk and pulling shots    
popping lids on top.     
He's done for the day    
in twenty-seven minutes    
and his thoughts drift    
to the courtyard outside    
where farmers have gathered    
to market their goods    
I notice his tattoo    
delicate lines    
inside his wrist    
A cowboy hat?    
I realize it's not    
It's a boa that ate an elephant    
and his distance expression     
makes so much sense.
