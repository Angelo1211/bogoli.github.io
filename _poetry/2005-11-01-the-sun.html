<p>I couldn’t imagine,<br/>
what it might be like,<br/>
to never see the sun again<br/>
to live under the cover of darkness<br/>
to never see light<br/>
sweet, bright, beautiful,<br/>
rays of light.<br/>
To come out with the moon,<br/>
When it conquers the realm,<br/>
of darkness and shadows,<br/>
with only a single beam,<br/>
of soft, silky moonlight<br/>
to guide your life…</p>
