<p>When we are alone and sad<br/>
It guides us like it always had.<br/>
in the dark it’s a glimmer<br/>
In the dark it’s a shimmer<br/>
Making you a little better, glad.</p>

<p>In the night, in the dark<br/>
It’s singing like a lark,<br/>
Pulling you through,<br/>
Helping you renew,<br/>
Even if it’s just a spark.</p>

<p>What would we do without hope,<br/>
I believe we could not cope,<br/>
Pulling us,<br/>
Drowning us,<br/>
Without hope, we could not<br/>
Hope.</p>
