<p>As I lie awake at night,<br/>
Submerged in endless thought,<br/>
I think, wonder and try,<br/>
As all my dreams are wrought.</p>

<p>My thoughts flow onto paper,<br/>
My pencil point grows dull,<br/>
As I write and dream and think,<br/>
My pencil almost gone.</p>

<p>The inferno that my pencil writes,<br/>
The infinity of night,<br/>
I am almost asleep, almost there,<br/>
And I know it will be alrightâ€¦</p>
