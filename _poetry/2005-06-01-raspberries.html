<p>Searching through leafy green<br/>
Such a pretty emerald green,<br/>
To find treasure of red<br/>
waiting to be seen.</p>

<p>Velvety to touch,<br/>
A ruby colored prize,<br/>
Hiding in a dress of green,<br/>
A treat for all the senses.</p>

<p>A sun-kissed gift<br/>
So full of sweet<br/>
Flavors mingle all together<br/>
Something just for meâ€¦</p>
