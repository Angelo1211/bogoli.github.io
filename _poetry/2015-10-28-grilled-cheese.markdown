Not so much the belly of the beast    
as the dingy clogged arteries    
somewhere deep in some limb     
lifeblood not really flowing      
so much as trickling      
I bite into my sandwich     
bacon fat boomerangs my face     
back towards thick Texas toast     
Grease creeping     
escaping the corners of my mouth    
heating up the cavern      
to just shy of burning      
uncomfortable, but I haven’t yet     
lost sensation       
I swig from my coffee      
not enough mocha      
far from enough cream    
and smaller than usual    
but I’m trying to cut back       
cutting out life’s little pleasures      
so I might not enjoy them      
a little bit longer      
The corridor is musty     
Weirdly wet where on building     
transitions to another    
But the solitude    
is warm.
