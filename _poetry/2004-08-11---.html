<p>It lingers in the air,<br/>
All around us while we stare<br/>
It enchants us,<br/>
It will catch us,<br/>
Eventually, while we stare.</p>

<p>Every day it is magic we see<br/>
On the land and in the sea,<br/>
No one knows<br/>
Thatâ€™s what it chose,<br/>
So nobody could see.</p>

<p>We only see a wisp of it.<br/>
only a scrap of it.<br/>
Just a little,<br/>
Just a little,<br/>
There is so much more of it.</p>
