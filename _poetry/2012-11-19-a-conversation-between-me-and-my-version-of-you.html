<p>your pathetic puppy dog eyes<br/> (that I fell in love with)<br/> so sad and hurt, like a baby&rsquo;s<br/> (clear and warm like the sea)<br/> your hands, I never liked themÂ <br/> (always in mine)<br/> you called me all the time<br/> (you cared so much, too much)<br/> your irrational jealousy<br/> (you didn&rsquo;t want to lose me)<br/> you didn&rsquo;t understand me<br/> (you understood too well)<br/> I couldn&rsquo;t breathe<br/> (you left me breathless)<br/> I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over<br/> (I&rsquo;m hurt and don&rsquo;t want to admit)<br/> I&rsquo;m sad that I left you<br/> (but my choice still remains the same)<br/> I wish I could explain<br/> (there&rsquo;s no point anymore)<br/> I no longer know the good and the bad<br/> (two sides of the same coin)<br/> I think of the way the world ends<br/> (not with a bang, but with a whimper)<br/> I think of how much it applies<br/> (Vivien, maybe you&rsquo;d understand)<br/> And I think, and I think you&rsquo;d think the same,<br/> (we did think alike, after all)<br/> Between us fell the shadow<br/> (but we ended with a bang)</p>
