<p>A beast of speed and grace,<br/>
in a great giant race<br/>
A race against you,<br/>
in the morning dew,<br/>
A coat of glistening sweat,<br/>
Silver, shiney and wet,<br/>
The muscles rippling underneath,<br/>
The weapon still in its sheath,<br/>
Suddenly he stops and veers,<br/>
He is so close, so near,<br/>
He rears up, then backs down,<br/>
He snorts and spins, round and round,<br/>
He paws the ground and snorts again.<br/>
It seems like here heâ€™s been.<br/>
He trots off, without a sound,<br/>
Littered hoof prints on the ground.</p>
