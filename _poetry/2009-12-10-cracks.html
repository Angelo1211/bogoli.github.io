<p>Spiderweb fissures
spread thin probing fingers,
Clawing at flawless veneer.
Years later,
cracks widen,<br/>
gaping, yawning,<br/>
smacking lips<br/>
eating at perfect veneer.<br/>
Pieces flake,<br/>
falling like crumbs<br/>
to the floor.<br/>
White smiling china doll,<br/>
Turns in the light.<br/>
Half a face<br/>
eaten and gone<br/>
black rot<br/>
raw stench<br/>
dead, crawls with maggots,<br/>
the white china face<br/>
stripped away.</p>
