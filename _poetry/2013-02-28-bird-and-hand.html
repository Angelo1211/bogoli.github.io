<p>I read today that there are birds and hands<br/> An allegory, if you will<br/> Of lovers and couples <br/> And why some lovers fail<br/> And some couples fall apart<br/> I don&rsquo;t know what I am<br/> I guess it depends on what my love is<br/> But I think I&rsquo;m a bird.<br/> I&rsquo;m a bird <br/> But I like a hand that&rsquo;s soft and ever present <br/> Just enough to feel myself surrounded<br/> And light enough to know I&rsquo;m never trapped<br/> If it feels just right<br/> I&rsquo;ll always come back<br/> But if there&rsquo;s not enough of you there<br/> What is there to come back to, anyway?<br/> And if there&rsquo;s too much,<br/> How do I know you&rsquo;ll let me fly?<br/> I know why the caged bird sings, <br/> I long for freedom too,<br/> But I don&rsquo;t have the patience <br/> Or maybe I just don&rsquo;t trust enough.  <br/> My point is, I&rsquo;m a bird, <br/> And you&rsquo;re a bird,<br/> And two birds might never come together. <br/> Maybe you&rsquo;re a bird because that&rsquo;s what I told you I need. <br/> But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever know for sure. <br/>  </p>
