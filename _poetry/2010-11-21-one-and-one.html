<p>One and one<br/>
we are complete<br/>
your hands in mine<br/>
our souls do meet.<br/>
in this forest of confusion<br/>
in trees of power and abandon<br/>
we lie together<br/>
on mossy hills<br/>
and fairy lights twinkle above.</p>



<p>Tribal drums beat passion into<br/>
air that smells of rain<br/>
that pours away from us<br/>
yet everywhere inside at once</p>



<p>Voices, not ours, whisper<br/>through our empty place<br/>no one but one and one<br/>and ripples of water of love</p>



<p>Bridges burn in flames of emotion<br/>That I set fire to myself<br/>Manic happiness <br/>in the smell of matches<br/>We are alone.</p>



<p>Your breath<br/>tumultuous<br/>sumptuous<br/>delicious<br/>My breath<br/>caught<br/>stopped<br/>gone</p>



<p>Trembling up to feathery clouds<br/>floating, free of gravity<br/>no resistance from the air<br/>My hands clutch at you<br/>And we&rsquo;re free. </p>



<p>Laws of physics lie broken below<br/>Shattered glass and rubble<br/>Nothing is clear, my love,<br/>Sense, unmade<br/>Yet I know<br/>One and one<br/>make one. </p>
