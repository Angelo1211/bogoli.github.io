<p>Sitting quietly<br/>
Next to me<br/>
is noisyness<br/>
and darkness<br/>
the brothers who roam free,</p>

<p>They make things frightening<br/>
Like thunder and lightning<br/>
Shadows in the dark<br/>
howling wolves in the park<br/>
Then it’s gone, the sky lightning.</p>

<p>Peacefulness comes in,<br/>
time and time again,<br/>
Like deep sleep,<br/>
or quietness knee deep<br/>
Like it’s never been.</p>
