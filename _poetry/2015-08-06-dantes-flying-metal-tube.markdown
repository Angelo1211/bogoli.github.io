Jeweled, glimmering beetles crawl    
along toy sized roads     
Engine drones & bores    
into my temples    
and I lean into the rattling plastic    
grimy window frames    
the view below.    
Tiny people going about their day     
oblivious of my 7th level of hell     
38,000 feet above    
their tiny little heads. 

World's most obnoxious couple    
jabs at my seatback    
with what must be a cattle prod.   
She stands and props her elbow    
on my head    
by mistake,    
and I'm just     
done.
