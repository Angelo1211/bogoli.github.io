<p>Tall latte in a to-stay cup<br/>
you’re my favorite pick me up.<br/>
Creamy white froth<br/>
speckled with brown<br/>
rambunctious strangers<br/>
crowd all around<br/>
Too bad the rhyme fell apart.<br/>
From simple caffeine intake system,<br/>
into something more sophisticated,<br/>
you morph. <br/>
White china, or porcelain<br/>
I’m not really sure,<br/>
but either way, you are<br/>
pleasantly weighty in my hand.<br/>
Hot burns the roof of my mouth,<br/>
coffee scent assaults my nose,<br/>
I am enveloped in bliss.</p>
