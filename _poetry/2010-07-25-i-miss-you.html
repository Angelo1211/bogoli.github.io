<p>Love<br/>
torn from hands<br/>
a gasp<br/>
as fingers slip through mine,<br/>
the empty air<br/>
stings<br/>
the tips of digits<br/>
that just touched love.<br/>
and echo the sting of heart,<br/>
which flows into a numbing pain,<br/>
a fist of fingers<br/>
that couldn&rsquo;t hold on to mine,<br/>
Now squeeze the happiness from my heart,<br/>
and I miss you.<br/>
Though these words seem so inadequate.<br/>
Empty<br/>
and cold.<br/>
Like my heart.<br/>
Come back.<br/>
Make me whole.<br/>
I miss you.</p>

<p>I hug a pillow<br/>
to my chest<br/>
in vain effot<br/>
to miss you less.<br/>
closing my eyes<br/>
I picture your smile,<br/>
and cringe with pain,<br/>
at the lengthening miles.<br/>
Come back.<br/>
Make me whole.<br/>
I miss you.</p>

<p>Another man&rsquo;s hands<br/>
could never replace<br/>
the touch of your fingers<br/>
as they trail down my face.</p>

<p>Your calluses hard,<br/>
our fingers entwine<br/>
Your smile melts my heart<br/>
with your hand in mine<br/>
Come back.<br/>
Make me whole.<br/>
I miss you.</p>
