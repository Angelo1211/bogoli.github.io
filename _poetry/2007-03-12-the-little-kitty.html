<p>There’s a little kitty,<br/>
He lives in the barn,<br/>
He likes to play with me,<br/>
He prefers me over yarn.</p>

<p>Black in appearance,<br/>
With little white paws,<br/>
He would chase after birds,<br/>
Who made one too many caws.</p>

<p>Once in a while,<br/>
He’d get vivacious,<br/>
And scratch me on the arm,<br/>
It would really test my patience.</p>

<p>Then I’d chase him away,<br/>
And tell him goodbye,<br/>
And I couldn’t get him to leave,<br/>
No matter how I’d try.</p>

<p>He stayed with me the whole day,<br/>
Followed me around,<br/>
The little kitty,<br/>
A friend I had found.</p>
