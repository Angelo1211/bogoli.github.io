<p>If you are tooling in Athena webs,<br/>
In the great blue yonder,<br/>
When vitality of learning ebbs,<br/>
here, this question, ponder:<br/>
Could I join you in your fight,<br/>
and tool away into the night?</p>

<hr><p>We were tooling in Athena net<br/>
but our Santiago has a sleep debt<br/>
now, don&rsquo;t you, however, fret,<br/>
a Kevin&rsquo;s company you can still get.</p>
