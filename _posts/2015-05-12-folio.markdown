description: An update on taking this site live.  
---

My personal website is—dare I even say it?—*complete*. Having a personal website has given me a playground on which to grow my HTML + CSS skills. Today, that finally comes to fruition in the form of a fully-functional theme. I'm incredibly excited, and looking forward to working more with Jekyll. 

The next step for me now is to strip this site of content, fill it up with some Lorem ipsum, and give it its own repository. 

Next week is finals, so after tonight, I'm going to have to buckle down and study. After Monday, though, the worst of it will be over, and I can be back to coding and working. Next on the horizon: iTunesU course on iOS development, maybe another Jekyll theme. I might even throw some time towards my novel. The summer is full of possibility.
