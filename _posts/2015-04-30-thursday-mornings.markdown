description: a few thoughts on relaxation and motivation
---

Thursday mornings are my sacred time—an oasis in the midst of the workweek, a time to connect with my thoughts and my body. I enjoyed a leisurely morning. Yesterday was a drag, more so than typical weeks because I was feeling under the weather. I could hardly focus on anything, and I felt like I was on the verge of a headache all day. Today was much better, though not to the point where I felt like I should fit in a workout. 

It’s taken me quite a long time to realize that relaxation does not exclude motivation. I can be relaxed and motivated at the same time, and it’s all in my state of mind. This relaxing morning, I made myself some breakfast, had coffee with a friend I hadn’t seen in a long while, and did a load of laundry from start to finish. I watched a TED talk on stress for class, came up with some discussion questions based on that. I even knocked out a chunk of my new website (which is shaping up quite nicely, if I may say so myself). And it was the most relaxing morning I've had in a while, probably because I kept checking things off my list. 

I'm excited to move on to the portfolio section of the site, now that the blog is mostly finished. The theme ended up fairly minimalist, which, as we all know, is a kinder word for plain. I think one of these days I'm going to make a Jekyll theme for sale, something more colorful and customizeable. It's contagious and fun: there's just enough programming to make it much more engaging than a static site, and it's just big enough that I could probably crank one out in a week and feel accomplished. Next time, though, I want to start more from scratch. This one I shaped up from the default blank Jekyll site. 

Looking forward to getting this site up and running.
