I've come to dread Saturday nights. I used to not—in fact, I used to anticipate them, relish the thought of the upcoming night of possibilites. I used to scope out the parties, pick an outfit, throw on the stripper heels and forget my worries for a night. Now, not only do those worries come out to play like creepy horror movie children, but they bring back all the worries I pushed aside every previous Saturday night. I get to experience those worries, and go pictures, tweets, and all sorts of digital commemoration of all of my bad choices. Not only can I feel bad about the future, but I can simultaneously feel bad about the past. 

The more I think about it, the more I realize that every fucking Saturday night has been depressing and awful. I'm not a night person any more. I don't think I ever was, I think that I just ... wanted to be. Just another raindrop in the perfect storm to rock bottom. 

Now that things are on the so-called up-and-up, the flashbacks and throwbacks sting with more bite. Because the pain isn't constant, I can't get used to it. It doesn't dull, and I feel like I'm ripping apart the ventricals of my heart with each old picture that I scroll through. There's got to be something addicting to that pain, though, because I can't stop myself. 

I can't stop from opening another tab, typing in the name of my rapist. He pops into my mind like it's no big deal, like he's a friend I want to check up on, but the feeling makes me sick. I hate myself for doing that. He stares out of his profile with a menancing expression—he's holding a gun, wearing some kind of armed forces uniform. I close the tab before I can examine it further, but the damage is done. His expression is seared into my memory, brought up fresh, like a giant scab ripped off, now oozing blood again.
