This project was a group effort to create an application to expand tourism, both domestic and international, in China. Drawing from our own experiences, [Matt Tucker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuckermattr), [Nayeon Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nayeonk), and developed an web + mobile app concept that would allow users to easily share and collaborate on trip itineraries. 

The app revolved around a map view of attractions, which helps a user notice groupings of activities to more efficiently plan a trip. We theorized the integration of Machine Learning to smartly suggest activites and attractions that users would like to see, in the same way that Spotify Weekly curates a playlist to the user's taste. 

We developed a web interface that would allow detailed planning, and a mobile counterpart for on-the-go updates and directions.
