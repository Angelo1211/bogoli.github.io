Every project that was completed through the semester of Studio 2 was based on the simple premise of a process completely removed from architecture: protein methylation. The dichotomous nature of this process provided the logic for the creation of a dynamic and interactive Processing drawing, which then became the starting point for <!--two major projects.--> this major project.

 An expansion of the drawing into three dimensional space became a theoretical building space, made from plaster poured into a mold made of lasercut paperboard. The final piece measured one cubic foot.

A second major venture was the evolution of the Processing drawings into a usable space, rather than just a concept.

From the undulating nature of the drawings, I theoreticized a building with spaces that could expand and contract based on occupation, from study carrels with thickened, accordion walls for sound insulation, to larger, airier rooms that encourage interaction and study groups. From spaces of high density and activity in the drawings came rooms. Areas with lower density became smaller spaces within the building, lower rooflines providing coziness.
