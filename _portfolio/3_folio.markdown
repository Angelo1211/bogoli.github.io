This theme, my first, was born out of the need for flexibility with Jekyll. I wanted to combine a personal blog with a portfolio page, and wanted two separate layouts for that. I also wanted a simpler listing for my poetry, which I easily imported from Tumblr straight into markdown entries.

I started with the original install of Jekyll, cleaned it up, whitened it up, and made the focuswhite space, subtle transparencies, and Helvetica.

<div class="col three caption">
	The layouts all work together cohesively. Top left: main landing page, featuring blog posts. Top right: the About page, which uses FontAwesome icons linking to social media. Bottom left: Compact poetry listing for all of your work. Bottom right: Portfolio layout.
