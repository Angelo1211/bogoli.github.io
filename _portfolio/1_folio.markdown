This theme, my first, was born out of the need for flexibility with Jekyll. I wanted to combine a personal blog with a portfolio page, and wanted two separate layouts for that. It's simply a cleaned up version of the original Jekyll theme, focused around white space, subtle transparencies, and Helvetica.
