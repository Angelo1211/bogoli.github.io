When I first discovered Jekyll, I wasn't quite sure where to start. In looking for previously established themes, I came across [Single Paged](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged). I really liked the layout, and appreciated the ease of choosing colors. I wanted to make it my own, though, so I used that project as way to get familiar with Jekyll. 

I ultimately ended up using this template for my personal site, until I decided I needed several pages, for projects and writing and other things. This theme still remains one of my favorites.
